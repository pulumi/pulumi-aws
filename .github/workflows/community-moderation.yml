          Hello and thank you for your pull request! :heart: :sparkles:

          It looks like you're directly modifying files in the language SDKs, many of which are autogenerated.

          Be sure any files you're editing do not begin with a code generation warning.

          For generated files, you will need to make changes in `resources.go` instead, and [generate the code](https://github.com/pulumi/${{ github.event.repository.name }}/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#committing-generated-code).
