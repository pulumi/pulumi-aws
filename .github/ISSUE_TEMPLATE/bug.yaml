        If this is a bug you encountered while running a Pulumi command, please provide us with a minimal, 
        self-contained Pulumi program that reproduces this behavior so that we can investigate on our end. 
        Without a functional reproduction, we will not be able to prioritize this bug.
        **Note:** If the program output is more than a few lines, please send us a Gist or a link to a file.

        If this is something that is dependent on your environment, please also provide us with the output of
        `pulumi up --logtostderr --logflow -v=10` from the root of your project.
        We may also ask you to supply us with debug output following [these steps](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/using-pulumi/pulumi-packages/debugging-provider-packages/).
        **Note:** If the log output is more than a few lines, please send us a Gist or a link to a file.
