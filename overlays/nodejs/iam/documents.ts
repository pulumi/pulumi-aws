/**
 * You manage access in AWS by creating policies and attaching them to IAM identities or AWS resources. A policy is an
 * object in AWS that, when associated with an entity or resource, defines their permissions. AWS evaluates these
 * policies when a principal, such as a user, makes a request. Permissions in the policies determine whether the
 * request is allowed or denied.
 *
 * IAM policies define permissions for an action regardless of the method that you use to perform the operation. For
 * example, if a policy allows the `GetUser` action, then a user with that policy can get user information from the
 * AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API. When you create an IAM user, you can set up the user to
 * allow console or programmatic access. The IAM user can sign in to the console using a user name and password.
 * Or they can use access keys to work with the CLI or API.
 *
 * Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents. Identity-based policies, policies used to set boundaries, or AWS
 * STS boundary policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a user or role. Resource-based policies are JSON
 * policy documents that you attach to a resource. SCPs are JSON policy documents with restricted syntax that you
 * attach to an AWS Organizations organizational unit (OU). ACLs are also attached to a resource, but you must use a
 * different syntax.
 *
 * A JSON policy document includes these elements:
 *
 *     - Optional policywide information at the top of the document
 *     - One or more individual statements
 *
 * Each statement includes information about a single permission. If a policy includes multiple statements, AWS applies
 * a logical OR across the statements when evaluating them. If multiple policies apply to a request, AWS applies a
 * logical OR across all of those policies when evaluating them.
 *
 * For more details about IAM policies, please refer to the AWS documentation online:
 * https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html

/**
 * Use the Principal element to specify the user (IAM user, federated user, or assumed-role user), AWS account, AWS
 * service, or other principal entity that is allowed or denied access to a resource. You use the Principal element in
 * the trust policies for IAM roles and in resource-based policiesâ€”that is, in policies that you embed directly in a
 * resource. For example, you can embed such policies in an Amazon S3 bucket, an Amazon Glacier vault, an Amazon SNS
 * topic, an Amazon SQS queue, or an AWS KMS customer master key (CMK).
 *
 * Use the Principal element in these ways:
 *
 *     - In IAM roles, use the Principal element in the role's trust policy to specify who can assume the role. For
 *       cross-account access, you must specify the 12-digit identifier of the trusted account.
 *
 *       Note: After you create the role, you can change the account to "*" to allow everyone to assume the role. If
 *       you do this, we strongly recommend that you limit who can access the role through other means, such as a
 *       Condition element that limits access to only certain IP addresses. Do not leave your role accessible to
 *       everyone!
 *
 *     - In resource-based policies, use the Principal element to specify the accounts or users who are allowed to
 *       access the resource.
 *
 * Do not use the Principal element in policies that you attach to IAM users and groups. Similarly, you do not specify
 * a principal in the permission policy for an IAM role. In those cases, the principal is implicitly the user that the
 * policy is attached to (for IAM users) or the user who assumes the role (for role access policies). When the policy
 * is attached to an IAM group, the principal is the IAM user in that group who is making the request.
