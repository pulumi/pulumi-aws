# examples/serverless-app-repository-application

Basic example of deploying an application from the serverless app repository.
This deploys the [`AthenaCloudwatchConnector`](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications/ap-south-1/313922868085/AthenaCloudwatchConnector) from the Serverless Application Repository and sets it up as a data source in Athena. This allows you to query CloudWatch Logs using Athena.
