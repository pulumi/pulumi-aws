        ## core_instance_group Configuration Block
        
        Supported arguments for the `core_instance_group` configuration block:
        
        * `instance_type` - (Required) EC2 instance type for all instances in the instance group.
        * `autoscaling_policy` - (Optional) String containing the [EMR Auto Scaling Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-automatic-scaling.html) JSON.
        * `bid_price` - (Optional) Bid price for each EC2 instance in the instance group, expressed in USD. By setting this attribute, the instance group is being declared as a Spot Instance, and will implicitly create a Spot request. Leave this blank to use On-Demand Instances.
        * `ebs_config` - (Optional) Configuration block(s) for EBS volumes attached to each instance in the instance group. Detailed below.
        * `instance_count` - (Optional) Target number of instances for the instance group. Must be at least 1. Defaults to 1.
        * `name` - (Optional) Friendly name given to the instance group.
        
        ## ec2_attributes
        
        Attributes for the Amazon EC2 instances running the job flow
        
        * `key_name` - (Optional) Amazon EC2 key pair that can be used to ssh to the master node as the user called `hadoop`
        * `subnet_id` - (Optional) VPC subnet id where you want the job flow to launch. Cannot specify the `cc1.4xlarge` instance type for nodes of a job flow launched in a Amazon VPC
        * `additional_master_security_groups` - (Optional) String containing a comma separated list of additional Amazon EC2 security group IDs for the master node
        * `additional_slave_security_groups` - (Optional) String containing a comma separated list of additional Amazon EC2 security group IDs for the slave nodes as a comma separated string
        * `emr_managed_master_security_group` - (Optional) Identifier of the Amazon EC2 EMR-Managed security group for the master node
        * `emr_managed_slave_security_group` - (Optional) Identifier of the Amazon EC2 EMR-Managed security group for the slave nodes
        * `service_access_security_group` - (Optional) Identifier of the Amazon EC2 service-access security group - required when the cluster runs on a private subnet
        * `instance_profile` - (Required) Instance Profile for EC2 instances of the cluster assume this role
        
        > **NOTE on EMR-Managed security groups:** These security groups will have any
        missing inbound or outbound access rules added and maintained by AWS, to ensure
        proper communication between instances in a cluster. The EMR service will
        maintain these rules for groups provided in `emr_managed_master_security_group`
        and `emr_managed_slave_security_group`; attempts to remove the required rules
        may succeed, only for the EMR service to re-add them in a matter of minutes.
        This may cause Terraform to fail to destroy an environment that contains an EMR
        cluster, because the EMR service does not revoke rules added on deletion,
        leaving a cyclic dependency between the security groups that prevents their
        deletion. To avoid this, use the `revoke_rules_on_delete` optional attribute for
        any Security Group used in `emr_managed_master_security_group` and
        `emr_managed_slave_security_group`. See [Amazon EMR-Managed Security
        Groups](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-man-sec-groups.html)
        for more information about the EMR-managed security group rules.
