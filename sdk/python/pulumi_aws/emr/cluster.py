A list of `instance_group` objects for each instance group in the cluster. Exactly one of `master_instance_type` and `instance_group` must be specified. If `instance_group` is set, then it must contain a configuration block for at least the `MASTER` instance group type (as well as any additional instance groups). Cannot be specified if `master_instance_group` or `core_instance_group` configuration blocks are set. Defined below
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] keep_job_flow_alive_when_no_steps: Switch on/off run cluster with no steps or when all steps are complete (default is on)
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] kerberos_attributes: Kerberos configuration for the cluster. Defined below
        :param pulumi.Input[str] log_uri: S3 bucket to write the log files of the job flow. If a value is not provided, logs are not created

        :param pulumi.Input[str] scale_down_behavior: The way that individual Amazon EC2 instances terminate when an automatic scale-in activity occurs or an `instance group` is resized.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] security_configuration: The security configuration name to attach to the EMR cluster. Only valid for EMR clusters with `release_label` 4.8.0 or greater
        :param pulumi.Input[str] service_role: IAM role that will be assumed by the Amazon EMR service to access AWS resources
        :param pulumi.Input[float] step_concurrency_level: The number of steps that can be executed concurrently. You can specify a maximum of 256 steps. Only valid for EMR clusters with `release_label` 5.28.0 or greater. (default is 1)
        :param pulumi.Input[list] steps: List of steps to run when creating the cluster. Defined below. It is highly recommended to utilize [`ignoreChanges`](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/programming-model/#ignorechanges) if other steps are being managed outside of this provider.

Launching with multiple master nodes is only supported in EMR version 5.23.0+, and requires this resource's `core_instance_group` to be configured. Public (Internet accessible) instances must be created in VPC subnets that have [map public IP on launch](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/subnet.html#map_public_ip_on_launch) enabled. Termination protection is automatically enabled when launched with multiple master nodes and this provider must have the `termination_protection = false` configuration applied before destroying this resource.
          * `instanceRole` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The role of the instance group in the cluster. Valid values are: `MASTER`, `CORE`, and `TASK`.
          * `instance_type` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - EC2 instance type for all instances in the instance group.
          * `name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The name of the step.

        The **kerberos_attributes** object supports the following:

          * `adDomainJoinPassword` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The Active Directory password for `ad_domain_join_user`. This provider cannot perform drift detection of this configuration.
          * `adDomainJoinUser` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Required only when establishing a cross-realm trust with an Active Directory domain. A user with sufficient privileges to join resources to the domain. This provider cannot perform drift detection of this configuration.
          * `crossRealmTrustPrincipalPassword` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Required only when establishing a cross-realm trust with a KDC in a different realm. The cross-realm principal password, which must be identical across realms. This provider cannot perform drift detection of this configuration.
          * `kdcAdminPassword` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The password used within the cluster for the kadmin service on the cluster-dedicated KDC, which maintains Kerberos principals, password policies, and keytabs for the cluster. This provider cannot perform drift detection of this configuration.
          * `realm` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The name of the Kerberos realm to which all nodes in a cluster belong. For example, `EC2.INTERNAL`

        The **master_instance_group** object supports the following:

          * `bid_price` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Bid price for each EC2 instance in the instance group, expressed in USD. By setting this attribute, the instance group is being declared as a Spot Instance, and will implicitly create a Spot request. Leave this blank to use On-Demand Instances.
          * `ebs_configs` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - Configuration block(s) for EBS volumes attached to each instance in the instance group. Detailed below.
            * `iops` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) that the volume supports
            * `size` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The volume size, in gibibytes (GiB).
            * `type` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The volume type. Valid options are `gp2`, `io1`, `standard` and `st1`. See [EBS Volume Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html).
            * `volumesPerInstance` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The number of EBS volumes with this configuration to attach to each EC2 instance in the instance group (default is 1)

          * `id` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The ID of the EMR Cluster
          * `instance_count` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - Target number of instances for the instance group. Must be 1 or 3. Defaults to 1. Launching with multiple master nodes is only supported in EMR version 5.23.0+, and requires this resource's `core_instance_group` to be configured. Public (Internet accessible) instances must be created in VPC subnets that have [map public IP on launch](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/subnet.html#map_public_ip_on_launch) enabled. Termination protection is automatically enabled when launched with multiple master nodes and this provider must have the `termination_protection = false` configuration applied before destroying this resource.
          * `instance_type` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - EC2 instance type for all instances in the instance group.
          * `name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The name of the step.

        The **steps** object supports the following:

          * `actionOnFailure` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The action to take if the step fails. Valid values: `TERMINATE_JOB_FLOW`, `TERMINATE_CLUSTER`, `CANCEL_AND_WAIT`, and `CONTINUE`
          * `hadoopJarStep` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - The JAR file used for the step. Defined below.
            * `args` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - List of command line arguments passed to the JAR file's main function when executed.
            * `jar` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Path to a JAR file run during the step.
            * `mainClass` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Name of the main class in the specified Java file. If not specified, the JAR file should specify a Main-Class in its manifest file.
            * `properties` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - Key-Value map of Java properties that are set when the step runs. You can use these properties to pass key value pairs to your main function.

          * `name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The name of the step.
