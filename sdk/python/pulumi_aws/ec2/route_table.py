    """
    Provides a resource to create a VPC routing table.
    
    ~> **NOTE on Route Tables and Routes:** Terraform currently
    provides both a standalone Route resource and a Route Table resource with routes
    defined in-line. At this time you cannot use a Route Table with in-line routes
    in conjunction with any Route resources. Doing so will cause
    a conflict of rule settings and will overwrite rules.
    
    ~> **NOTE on `gateway_id` and `nat_gateway_id`:** The AWS API is very forgiving with these two
    attributes and the `aws_route_table` resource can be created with a NAT ID specified as a Gateway ID attribute.
    This _will_ lead to a permanent diff between your configuration and statefile, as the API returns the correct
    parameters in the returned route table. If you're experiencing constant diffs in your `aws_route_table` resources,
    the first thing to check is whether or not you're specifying a NAT ID instead of a Gateway ID, or vice-versa.
    
    ~> **NOTE on `propagating_vgws` and the `aws_vpn_gateway_route_propagation` resource:**
    If the `propagating_vgws` argument is present, it's not supported to _also_
    define route propagations using `aws_vpn_gateway_route_propagation`, since
    this resource will delete any propagating gateways not explicitly listed in
    `propagating_vgws`. Omit this argument when defining route propagation using
    the separate resource.
