        Provides an EC2 Spot Instance Request resource. This allows instances to be
        requested on the spot market.

        By default this provider creates Spot Instance Requests with a `persistent` type,
        which means that for the duration of their lifetime, AWS will launch an
        instance with the configured details if and when the spot market will accept
        the requested price.

        On destruction, this provider will make an attempt to terminate the associated Spot
        Instance if there is one present.

        Spot Instances requests with a `one-time` type will close the spot request
        when the instance is terminated either by the request being below the current spot
        price availability or by a user.

        > **NOTE:** Because their behavior depends on the live status of the spot
        market, Spot Instance Requests have a unique lifecycle that makes them behave
        differently than other resources. Most importantly: there is __no

            This must be set with a `volume_type` of `"io1"`.
          * `kms_key_id` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS Key to use when encrypting the volume. Must be configured to perform drift detection.
          * `snapshot_id` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The Snapshot ID to mount.
          * `volume_id` (`pulumi.Input[str]`)
          * `volume_size` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The size of the volume in gibibytes (GiB).
          * `volumeType` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The type of volume. Can be `"standard"`, `"gp2"`,
            or `"io1"`. (Default: `"gp2"`).

        The **ephemeral_block_devices** object supports the following:

          * `device_name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The name of the block device to mount on the instance.
          * `noDevice` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - Suppresses the specified device included in the AMI's block device mapping.
          * `virtualName` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The [Instance Store Device
            Name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html#InstanceStoreDeviceNames)
            (e.g. `"ephemeral0"`).

        The **metadata_options** object supports the following:

          * `httpEndpoint` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Whether the metadata service is available. Can be `"enabled"` or `"disabled"`. (Default: `"enabled"`).
          * `httpPutResponseHopLimit` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The desired HTTP PUT response hop limit for instance metadata requests. The larger the number, the further instance metadata requests can travel. Can be an integer from `1` to `64`. (Default: `1`).
          * `httpTokens` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Whether or not the metadata service requires session tokens, also referred to as _Instance Metadata Service Version 2_. Can be `"optional"` or `"required"`. (Default: `"optional"`).

        The **network_interfaces** object supports the following:

          * `deleteOnTermination` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - Whether or not to delete the network interface on instance termination. Defaults to `false`. Currently, the only valid value is `false`, as this is only supported when creating new network interfaces when launching an instance.
          * `device_index` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The integer index of the network interface attachment. Limited by instance type.
          * `network_interface_id` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The ID of the network interface to attach.

        The **root_block_device** object supports the following:

          * `deleteOnTermination` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - Whether the volume should be destroyed
            on instance termination (Default: `true`).
          * `encrypted` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - Enable volume encryption. (Default: `false`). Must be configured to perform drift detection.
          * `iops` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The amount of provisioned
            [IOPS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-io-characteristics.html).
            This is only valid for `volume_type` of `"io1"`, and must be specified if
            using that type
          * `kms_key_id` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS Key to use when encrypting the volume. Must be configured to perform drift detection.
          * `volume_id` (`pulumi.Input[str]`)
          * `volume_size` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The size of the volume in gibibytes (GiB).
          * `volumeType` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The type of volume. Can be `"standard"`, `"gp2"`, `"io1"`, `"sc1"`, or `"st1"`. (Default: `"standard"`).
