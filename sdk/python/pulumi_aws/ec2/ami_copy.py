    The "AMI copy" resource allows duplication of an Amazon Machine Image (AMI),
    including cross-region copies.
    
    If the source AMI has associated EBS snapshots, those will also be duplicated
    along with the AMI.
    
    This is useful for taking a single AMI provisioned in one region and making
    it available in another for a multi-region deployment.
    
    Copying an AMI can take several minutes. The creation of this resource will
    block until the new AMI is available for use on new instances.
