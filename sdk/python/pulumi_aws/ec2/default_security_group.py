class DefaultSecurityGroup(pulumi.CustomResource):
    """
    Provides a resource to manage the default AWS Security Group.
    
    For EC2 Classic accounts, each region comes with a Default Security Group.
    Additionally, each VPC created in AWS comes with a Default Security Group that can be managed, but not
    destroyed. **This is an advanced resource**, and has special caveats to be aware
    of when using it. Please read this document in its entirety before using this
    resource.
    
    The `aws_default_security_group` behaves differently from normal resources, in that
    Terraform does not _create_ this resource, but instead "adopts" it
    into management. We can do this because these default security groups cannot be
    destroyed, and are created with a known set of default ingress/egress rules.
    
    When Terraform first adopts the Default Security Group, it **immediately removes all
    ingress and egress rules in the Security Group**. It then proceeds to create any rules specified in the
    configuration. This step is required so that only the rules specified in the
    configuration are created.
    
    This resource treats its inline rules as absolute; only the rules defined
    inline are created, and any additions/removals external to this resource will
    result in diff shown. For these reasons, this resource is incompatible with the
    `aws_security_group_rule` resource.
    
    For more information about Default Security Groups, see the AWS Documentation on
    [Default Security Groups][aws-default-security-groups].
