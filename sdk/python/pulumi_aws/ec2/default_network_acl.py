class DefaultNetworkAcl(pulumi.CustomResource):
    """
    Provides a resource to manage the default AWS Network ACL. VPC Only.
    
    Each VPC created in AWS comes with a Default Network ACL that can be managed, but not
    destroyed. **This is an advanced resource**, and has special caveats to be aware
    of when using it. Please read this document in its entirety before using this
    resource.
    
    The `aws_default_network_acl` behaves differently from normal resources, in that
    Terraform does not _create_ this resource, but instead attempts to "adopt" it
    into management. We can do this because each VPC created has a Default Network
    ACL that cannot be destroyed, and is created with a known set of default rules.
    
    When Terraform first adopts the Default Network ACL, it **immediately removes all
    rules in the ACL**. It then proceeds to create any rules specified in the
    configuration. This step is required so that only the rules specified in the
    configuration are created.
    
    This resource treats its inline rules as absolute; only the rules defined
    inline are created, and any additions/removals external to this resource will
    result in diffs being shown. For these reasons, this resource is incompatible with the
    `aws_network_acl_rule` resource.
    
    For more information about Network ACLs, see the AWS Documentation on
    [Network ACLs][aws-network-acls].
