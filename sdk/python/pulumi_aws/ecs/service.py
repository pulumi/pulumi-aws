        :param pulumi.Input[str] launch_type: The launch type on which to run your service. The valid values are `EC2` and `FARGATE`. Defaults to `EC2`.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] load_balancers: A load balancer block. Load balancers documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] name: The name of the service (up to 255 letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores)
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] network_configuration: The network configuration for the service. This parameter is required for task definitions that use the `awsvpc` network mode to receive their own Elastic Network Interface, and it is not supported for other network modes.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] ordered_placement_strategies: Service level strategy rules that are taken into consideration during task placement. List from top to bottom in order of precedence. The maximum number of `ordered_placement_strategy` blocks is `5`. Defined below.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] placement_constraints: rules that are taken into consideration during task placement. Maximum number of
               `placement_constraints` is `10`. Defined below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] platform_version: The platform version on which to run your service. Only applicable for `launch_type` set to `FARGATE`. Defaults to `LATEST`. More information about Fargate platform versions can be found in the [AWS ECS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html).
        :param pulumi.Input[str] propagate_tags: Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the task definition or the service to the tasks. The valid values are `SERVICE` and `TASK_DEFINITION`.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] scheduling_strategy: The scheduling strategy to use for the service. The valid values are `REPLICA` and `DAEMON`. Defaults to `REPLICA`. Note that [*Fargate tasks do not support the `DAEMON` scheduling strategy*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/scheduling_tasks.html).
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] service_registries: The service discovery registries for the service. The maximum number of `service_registries` blocks is `1`.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] tags: Key-value mapping of resource tags
        :param pulumi.Input[str] task_definition: The family and revision (`family:revision`) or full ARN of the task definition that you want to run in your service.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] wait_for_steady_state: If `true`, this provider will wait for the service to reach a steady state (like [`aws ecs wait services-stable`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecs/wait/services-stable.html)) before continuing. Default `false`.

        The **capacity_provider_strategies** object supports the following:

          * `base` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The number of tasks, at a minimum, to run on the specified capacity provider. Only one capacity provider in a capacity provider strategy can have a base defined.
          * `capacityProvider` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the capacity provider.
          * `weight` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The relative percentage of the total number of launched tasks that should use the specified capacity provider.

        The **deployment_controller** object supports the following:

          * `type` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Type of deployment controller. Valid values: `CODE_DEPLOY`, `ECS`. Default: `ECS`.

        The **load_balancers** object supports the following:

          * `container_name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The name of the container to associate with the load balancer (as it appears in a container definition).
          * `containerPort` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The port on the container to associate with the load balancer.
          * `elbName` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The name of the ELB (Classic) to associate with the service.
          * `target_group_arn` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The ARN of the Load Balancer target group to associate with the service.

        The **network_configuration** object supports the following:

          * `assignPublicIp` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - Assign a public IP address to the ENI (Fargate launch type only). Valid values are `true` or `false`. Default `false`.
          * `security_groups` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - The security groups associated with the task or service. If you do not specify a security group, the default security group for the VPC is used.
          * `subnets` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - The subnets associated with the task or service.

        The **ordered_placement_strategies** object supports the following:

          * `field` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - For the `spread` placement strategy, valid values are `instanceId` (or `host`,
            which has the same effect), or any platform or custom attribute that is applied to a container instance.
            For the `binpack` type, valid values are `memory` and `cpu`. For the `random` type, this attribute is not
            needed. For more information, see [Placement Strategy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_PlacementStrategy.html).
          * `type` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The type of placement strategy. Must be one of: `binpack`, `random`, or `spread`

        The **placement_constraints** object supports the following:

          * `expression` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Cluster Query Language expression to apply to the constraint. Does not need to be specified
            for the `distinctInstance` type.
            For more information, see [Cluster Query Language in the Amazon EC2 Container
            Service Developer
            Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/cluster-query-language.html).
          * `type` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The type of constraint. The only valid values at this time are `memberOf` and `distinctInstance`.

        The **service_registries** object supports the following:

          * `container_name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The container name value, already specified in the task definition, to be used for your service discovery service.
          * `containerPort` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The port value, already specified in the task definition, to be used for your service discovery service.
          * `port` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The port value used if your Service Discovery service specified an SRV record.
          * `registryArn` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The ARN of the Service Registry. The currently supported service registry is Amazon Route 53 Auto Naming Service(`servicediscovery.Service`). For more information, see [Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_autonaming_Service.html)
