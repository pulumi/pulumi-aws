        ## Example Usage

        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_aws as aws

        mongo = aws.ecs.Service("mongo",
            cluster=aws_ecs_cluster["foo"]["id"],
            task_definition=aws_ecs_task_definition["mongo"]["arn"],
            desired_count=3,
            iam_role=aws_iam_role["foo"]["arn"],

                "type": "binpack",
                "field": "cpu",
            }],
            load_balancers=[{
                "target_group_arn": aws_lb_target_group["foo"]["arn"],
                "container_name": "mongo",

            opts=ResourceOptions(depends_on=["aws_iam_role_policy.foo"]))
        ```
        ### Ignoring Changes to Desired Count

        You can use [`ignoreChanges`](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/programming-model/#ignorechanges) to create an ECS service with an initial count of running instances, then ignore any changes to that count caused externally (e.g. Application Autoscaling).

        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_aws as aws

        example = aws.ecs.Service("example",
            desired_count=2,
            lifecycle={
                "ignoreChanges": ["desiredCount"],
            })
        ```
        ### Daemon Scheduling Strategy

        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_aws as aws

        bar = aws.ecs.Service("bar",
            cluster=aws_ecs_cluster["foo"]["id"],
            scheduling_strategy="DAEMON",
            task_definition=aws_ecs_task_definition["bar"]["arn"])
        ```
        ### External Deployment Controller

        import pulumi
        import pulumi_aws as aws

        example = aws.ecs.Service("example",
            cluster=aws_ecs_cluster["example"]["id"],

        :param pulumi.Input[float] deployment_maximum_percent: The upper limit (as a percentage of the service's desiredCount) of the number of running tasks that can be running in a service during a deployment. Not valid when using the `DAEMON` scheduling strategy.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] deployment_minimum_healthy_percent: The lower limit (as a percentage of the service's desiredCount) of the number of running tasks that must remain running and healthy in a service during a deployment.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] desired_count: The number of instances of the task definition to place and keep running. Defaults to 0. Do not specify if using the `DAEMON` scheduling strategy.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] enable_ecs_managed_tags: Specifies whether to enable Amazon ECS managed tags for the tasks within the service.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] force_new_deployment: Enable to force a new task deployment of the service. This can be used to update tasks to use a newer Docker image with same image/tag combination (e.g. `myimage:latest`), roll Fargate tasks onto a newer platform version, or immediately deploy `ordered_placement_strategy` and `placement_constraints` updates.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] health_check_grace_period_seconds: Seconds to ignore failing load balancer health checks on newly instantiated tasks to prevent premature shutdown, up to 2147483647. Only valid for services configured to use load balancers.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] iam_role: ARN of the IAM role that allows Amazon ECS to make calls to your load balancer on your behalf. This parameter is required if you are using a load balancer with your service, but only if your task definition does not use the `awsvpc` network mode. If using `awsvpc` network mode, do not specify this role. If your account has already created the Amazon ECS service-linked role, that role is used by default for your service unless you specify a role here.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] launch_type: The launch type on which to run your service. The valid values are `EC2` and `FARGATE`. Defaults to `EC2`.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] load_balancers: A load balancer block. Load balancers documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] name: The name of the service (up to 255 letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores)
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] network_configuration: The network configuration for the service. This parameter is required for task definitions that use the `awsvpc` network mode to receive their own Elastic Network Interface, and it is not supported for other network modes.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] ordered_placement_strategies: Service level strategy rules that are taken into consideration during task placement. List from top to bottom in order of precedence. Updates to this configuration will take effect next task deployment unless `force_new_deployment` is enabled. The maximum number of `ordered_placement_strategy` blocks is `5`. Defined below.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] placement_constraints: rules that are taken into consideration during task placement. Updates to this configuration will take effect next task deployment unless `force_new_deployment` is enabled. Maximum number of `placement_constraints` is `10`. Defined below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] platform_version: The platform version on which to run your service. Only applicable for `launch_type` set to `FARGATE`. Defaults to `LATEST`. More information about Fargate platform versions can be found in the [AWS ECS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html).
        :param pulumi.Input[str] propagate_tags: Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the task definition or the service to the tasks. The valid values are `SERVICE` and `TASK_DEFINITION`.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] scheduling_strategy: The scheduling strategy to use for the service. The valid values are `REPLICA` and `DAEMON`. Defaults to `REPLICA`. Note that [*Tasks using the Fargate launch type or the `CODE_DEPLOY` or `EXTERNAL` deployment controller types don't support the `DAEMON` scheduling strategy*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateService.html).
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] service_registries: The service discovery registries for the service. The maximum number of `service_registries` blocks is `1`.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] tags: Key-value map of resource tags
        :param pulumi.Input[str] task_definition: The family and revision (`family:revision`) or full ARN of the task definition that you want to run in your service. Required unless using the `EXTERNAL` deployment controller. If a revision is not specified, the latest `ACTIVE` revision is used.

        The **capacity_provider_strategies** object supports the following:

          * `base` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - The number of tasks, at a minimum, to run on the specified capacity provider. Only one capacity provider in a capacity provider strategy can have a base defined.

        The **ordered_placement_strategies** object supports the following:

          * `field` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - For the `spread` placement strategy, valid values are `instanceId` (or `host`,
            which has the same effect), or any platform or custom attribute that is applied to a container instance.
            For the `binpack` type, valid values are `memory` and `cpu`. For the `random` type, this attribute is not
            needed. For more information, see [Placement Strategy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_PlacementStrategy.html).
