    A Health Check block. Health Check blocks are documented below.

      * `enabled` (`bool`) - Indicates whether  health checks are enabled. Defaults to true.
      * `healthyThreshold` (`float`) - The number of consecutive health checks successes required before considering an unhealthy target healthy. Defaults to 3.
      * `interval` (`float`) - The approximate amount of time, in seconds, between health checks of an individual target. Minimum value 5 seconds, Maximum value 300 seconds. For `lambda` target groups, it needs to be greater as the `timeout` of the underlying `lambda`. Default 30 seconds.
      * `matcher` (`str`)
      * `path` (`str`) - The destination for the health check request. Applies to Application Load Balancers only (HTTP/HTTPS), not Network Load Balancers (TCP).
      * `port` (`str`) - The port to use to connect with the target. Valid values are either ports 1-65535, or `traffic-port`. Defaults to `traffic-port`.

For Network Load Balancers, you cannot set a custom value, and the default is 10 seconds for TCP and HTTPS health checks and 6 seconds for HTTP health checks.
      * `unhealthyThreshold` (`float`) - The number of consecutive health check failures required before considering the target unhealthy . For Network Load Balancers, this value must be the same as the `healthy_threshold`. Defaults to 3.
        * `matcher` (Required for HTTP/HTTPS ALB) The HTTP codes to use when checking for a successful response from a target. You can specify multiple values (for example, "200,202") or a range of values (for example, "200-299"). Applies to Application Load Balancers only (HTTP/HTTPS), not Network Load Balancers (TCP).
