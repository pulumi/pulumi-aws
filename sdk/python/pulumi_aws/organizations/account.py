        Provides a resource to create a member account in the current organization.

        > **Note:** Account management must be done from the organization's master account.

        !> **WARNING:** Deleting this resource will only remove an AWS account from an organization. This provider will not close the account. The member account must be prepared to be a standalone account beforehand. See the [AWS Organizations documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_remove.html) for more information.
