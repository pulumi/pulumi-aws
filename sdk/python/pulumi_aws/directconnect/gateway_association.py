        Associates a Direct Connect Gateway with a VGW or transit gateway.

        To create a cross-account association, create an `directconnect.GatewayAssociationProposal` resource
        in the AWS account that owns the VGW or transit gateway and then accept the proposal in the AWS account that owns the Direct Connect Gateway
        by creating an `directconnect.GatewayAssociation` resource with the `proposal_id` and `associated_gateway_owner_account_id` attributes set.

        ## Example Usage

        ### VPN Gateway Association

        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_aws as aws

        example_gateway = aws.directconnect.Gateway("exampleGateway", amazon_side_asn="64512")
        example_vpc = aws.ec2.Vpc("exampleVpc", cidr_block="10.255.255.0/28")
        example_vpn_gateway = aws.ec2.VpnGateway("exampleVpnGateway", vpc_id=example_vpc.id)
        example_gateway_association = aws.directconnect.GatewayAssociation("exampleGatewayAssociation",
            associated_gateway_id=example_vpn_gateway.id,
            dx_gateway_id=example_gateway.id)
        ```

        ### Transit Gateway Association

        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_aws as aws

        example_gateway = aws.directconnect.Gateway("exampleGateway", amazon_side_asn="64512")
        example_transit_gateway = aws.ec2transitgateway.TransitGateway("exampleTransitGateway")
        example_gateway_association = aws.directconnect.GatewayAssociation("exampleGatewayAssociation",
            allowed_prefixes=[
                "10.255.255.0/30",
