        Provides an AutoScaling Group resource.

        > **Note:** You must specify either `launch_configuration`, `launch_template`, or `mixed_instances_policy`.

        ## Waiting for Capacity

        A newly-created ASG is initially empty and begins to scale to `min_size` (or
        `desired_capacity`, if specified) by launching instances using the provided
        Launch Configuration. These instances take time to launch and boot.

        On ASG Update, changes to these values also take time to result in the target
        number of instances providing service.

        This provider provides two mechanisms to help consistently manage ASG scale up
        time across dependent resources.

        #### Waiting for ASG Capacity

        The first is default behavior. This provider waits after ASG creation for
        `min_size` (or `desired_capacity`, if specified) healthy instances to show up
        in the ASG before continuing.

        If `min_size` or `desired_capacity` are changed in a subsequent update,
        this provider will also wait for the correct number of healthy instances before
        continuing.

        This provider considers an instance "healthy" when the ASG reports `HealthStatus:
        "Healthy"` and `LifecycleState: "InService"`. See the [AWS AutoScaling
        Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/DeveloperGuide/AutoScalingGroupLifecycle.html)
        for more information on an ASG's lifecycle.

        This provider will wait for healthy instances for up to
        `wait_for_capacity_timeout`. If ASG creation is taking more than a few minutes,
        it's worth investigating for scaling activity errors, which can be caused by
        problems with the selected Launch Configuration.

        Setting `wait_for_capacity_timeout` to `"0"` disables ASG Capacity waiting.

        #### Waiting for ELB Capacity

        The second mechanism is optional, and affects ASGs with attached ELBs specified
        via the `load_balancers` attribute or with ALBs specified with `target_group_arns`.

        The `min_elb_capacity` parameter causes this provider to wait for at least the
        requested number of instances to show up `"InService"` in all attached ELBs
        during ASG creation.  It has no effect on ASG updates.

        If `wait_for_elb_capacity` is set, this provider will wait for exactly that number
        of Instances to be `"InService"` in all attached ELBs on both creation and
        updates.

        These parameters can be used to ensure that service is being provided before
        this provider moves on. If new instances don't pass the ELB's health checks for any
        reason, the deployment will time out, and the ASG will be marked as
        tainted (i.e. marked to be destroyed in a follow up run).

        As with ASG Capacity, this provider will wait for up to `wait_for_capacity_timeout`
        for the proper number of instances to be healthy.

        #### Troubleshooting Capacity Waiting Timeouts

        If ASG creation takes more than a few minutes, this could indicate one of a
        number of configuration problems. See the [AWS Docs on Load Balancer
        Troubleshooting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/elb-troubleshooting.html)
        for more information.

        Get an existing Group resource's state with the given name, id, and optional extra
        properties used to qualify the lookup.

        :param str resource_name: The unique name of the resulting resource.
        :param str id: The unique provider ID of the resource to lookup.
        :param pulumi.ResourceOptions opts: Options for the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] arn: The ARN for this AutoScaling Group
        :param pulumi.Input[list] availability_zones: A list of one or more availability zones for the group. This parameter should not be specified when using `vpc_zone_identifier`.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] default_cooldown: The amount of time, in seconds, after a scaling activity completes before another scaling activity can start.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] desired_capacity: The number of Amazon EC2 instances that
               should be running in the group. (See also Waiting for
               Capacity below.)
        :param pulumi.Input[list] enabled_metrics: A list of metrics to collect. The allowed values are `GroupDesiredCapacity`, `GroupInServiceCapacity`, `GroupPendingCapacity`, `GroupMinSize`, `GroupMaxSize`, `GroupInServiceInstances`, `GroupPendingInstances`, `GroupStandbyInstances`, `GroupStandbyCapacity`, `GroupTerminatingCapacity`, `GroupTerminatingInstances`, `GroupTotalCapacity`, `GroupTotalInstances`.
               * `wait_for_capacity_timeout` (Default: "10m") A maximum
               [duration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) that this provider should
               wait for ASG instances to be healthy before timing out.  (See also Waiting
               for Capacity below.) Setting this to "0" causes
               this provider to skip all Capacity Waiting behavior.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] force_delete: Allows deleting the autoscaling group without waiting
               for all instances in the pool to terminate.  You can force an autoscaling group to delete
               even if it's in the process of scaling a resource. Normally, this provider
               drains all the instances before deleting the group.  This bypasses that
               behavior and potentially leaves resources dangling.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] health_check_grace_period: Time (in seconds) after instance comes into service before checking health.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] health_check_type: "EC2" or "ELB". Controls how health checking is done.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] initial_lifecycle_hooks: One or more
               [Lifecycle Hooks](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/latest/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html)
               to attach to the autoscaling group **before** instances are launched. The
               syntax is exactly the same as the separate
               [`autoscaling.LifecycleHook`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/autoscaling_lifecycle_hook.html)
               resource, without the `autoscaling_group_name` attribute. Please note that this will only work when creating
               a new autoscaling group. For all other use-cases, please use `autoscaling.LifecycleHook` resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] launch_configuration: The name of the launch configuration to use.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] launch_template: Nested argument containing launch template settings along with the overrides to specify multiple instance types and weights. Defined below.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] load_balancers: A list of elastic load balancer names to add to the autoscaling
               group names. Only valid for classic load balancers. For ALBs, use `target_group_arns` instead.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] max_instance_lifetime: The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that an instance can be in service, values must be either equal to 0 or between 604800 and 31536000 seconds.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] max_size: The maximum size of the auto scale group.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] metrics_granularity: The granularity to associate with the metrics to collect. The only valid value is `1Minute`. Default is `1Minute`.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] min_elb_capacity: Setting this causes this provider to wait for
               this number of instances from this autoscaling group to show up healthy in the
               ELB only on creation. Updates will not wait on ELB instance number changes.
               (See also Waiting for Capacity below.)
        :param pulumi.Input[float] min_size: The minimum size of the auto scale group.
               (See also Waiting for Capacity below.)
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] mixed_instances_policy: Configuration block containing settings to define launch targets for Auto Scaling groups. Defined below.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] name: The name of the auto scaling group. By default generated by this provider.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] name_prefix: Creates a unique name beginning with the specified
               prefix. Conflicts with `name`.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] placement_group: The name of the placement group into which you'll launch your instances, if any.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] protect_from_scale_in: Allows setting instance protection. The
               autoscaling group will not select instances with this setting for terminination
               during scale in events.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] service_linked_role_arn: The ARN of the service-linked role that the ASG will use to call other AWS services
        :param pulumi.Input[list] suspended_processes: A list of processes to suspend for the AutoScaling Group. The allowed values are `Launch`, `Terminate`, `HealthCheck`, `ReplaceUnhealthy`, `AZRebalance`, `AlarmNotification`, `ScheduledActions`, `AddToLoadBalancer`.
               Note that if you suspend either the `Launch` or `Terminate` process types, it can prevent your autoscaling group from functioning properly.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] tags: A list of tag blocks. Tags documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] tags_collection: A list of tag blocks (maps). Tags documented below.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] target_group_arns: A list of `alb.TargetGroup` ARNs, for use with Application or Network Load Balancing.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] termination_policies: A list of policies to decide how the instances in the auto scale group should be terminated. The allowed values are `OldestInstance`, `NewestInstance`, `OldestLaunchConfiguration`, `ClosestToNextInstanceHour`, `OldestLaunchTemplate`, `AllocationStrategy`, `Default`.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] vpc_zone_identifiers: A list of subnet IDs to launch resources in.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] wait_for_elb_capacity: Setting this will cause this provider to wait
               for exactly this number of healthy instances from this autoscaling group in
               all attached load balancers on both create and update operations. (Takes
               precedence over `min_elb_capacity` behavior.)
