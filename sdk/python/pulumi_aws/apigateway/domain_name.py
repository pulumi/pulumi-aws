class DomainName(pulumi.CustomResource):
    """
    Registers a custom domain name for use with AWS API Gateway.
    
    This resource just establishes ownership of and the TLS settings for
    a particular domain name. An API can be attached to a particular path
    under the registered domain name using
    the `aws_api_gateway_base_path_mapping` resource.
    
    API Gateway domains can be defined as either 'edge-optimized' or 'regional'.  In an edge-optimized configuration,
    API Gateway internally creates and manages a CloudFront distribution to route requests on the given hostname. In
    addition to this resource it's necessary to create a DNS record corresponding to the given domain name which is an alias
    (either Route53 alias or traditional CNAME) to the Cloudfront domain name exported in the `cloudfront_domain_name`
    attribute.
    
    In a regional configuration, API Gateway does not create a CloudFront distribution to route requests to the API, though
    a distribution can be created if needed. In either case, it is necessary to create a DNS record corresponding to the
    given domain name which is an alias (either Route53 alias or traditional CNAME) to the regional domain name exported in
    the `regional_domain_name` attribute.
