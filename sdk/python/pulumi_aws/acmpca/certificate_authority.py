        Provides a resource to manage AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authorities (ACM PCA Certificate Authorities).

        > **NOTE:** Creating this resource will leave the certificate authority in a `PENDING_CERTIFICATE` status, which means it cannot yet issue certificates. To complete this setup, you must fully sign the certificate authority CSR available in the `certificate_signing_request` attribute and import the signed certificate using the AWS SDK, CLI or Console. This provider can support another resource to manage that workflow automatically in the future.

        ## Example Usage

        ### Basic

        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_aws as aws

        example = aws.acmpca.CertificateAuthority("example",
            certificate_authority_configuration={
                "keyAlgorithm": "RSA_4096",
                "signingAlgorithm": "SHA512WITHRSA",
                "subject": {
                    "commonName": "example.com",
                },
            },
            permanent_deletion_time_in_days=7)
        ```

        ### Enable Certificate Revocation List

        ```python
