        Provides a resource to manage AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authorities (ACM PCA Certificate Authorities).

        > **NOTE:** Creating this resource will leave the certificate authority in a `PENDING_CERTIFICATE` status, which means it cannot yet issue certificates. To complete this setup, you must fully sign the certificate authority CSR available in the `certificate_signing_request` attribute and import the signed certificate using the AWS SDK, CLI or Console. This provider can support another resource to manage that workflow automatically in the future.
