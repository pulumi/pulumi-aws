        > **NOTE:** Due to [AWS Lambda improved VPC networking changes that began deploying in September 2019](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/announcing-improved-vpc-networking-for-aws-lambda-functions/), EC2 subnets and security groups associated with Lambda Functions can take up to 45 minutes to successfully delete.

        ## Example Usage

        ### Lambda Layers

        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_aws as aws

        example_layer_version = aws.lambda_.LayerVersion("exampleLayerVersion")
        example_function = aws.lambda_.Function("exampleFunction", layers=[example_layer_version.arn])
        ```

        ## CloudWatch Logging and Permissions

        For more information about CloudWatch Logs for Lambda, see the [Lambda User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-functions-logs.html).

        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_aws as aws

        test_lambda = aws.lambda_.Function("testLambda")
        # This is to optionally manage the CloudWatch Log Group for the Lambda Function.
        # If skipping this resource configuration, also add "logs:CreateLogGroup" to the IAM policy below.
        example = aws.cloudwatch.LogGroup("example", retention_in_days=14)
        # See also the following AWS managed policy: AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole
        lambda_logging = aws.iam.Policy("lambdaLogging",
            description="IAM policy for logging from a lambda",
            path="/",
            policy=\"\"\"{
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
            {
              "Action": [
                "logs:CreateLogGroup",
                "logs:CreateLogStream",
                "logs:PutLogEvents"
              ],
              "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:*:*:*",
              "Effect": "Allow"
            }
          ]
        }

        \"\"\")
        lambda_logs = aws.iam.RolePolicyAttachment("lambdaLogs",
            policy_arn=lambda_logging.arn,
            role=aws_iam_role["iam_for_lambda"]["name"])
        ```

        ## Specifying the Deployment Package

        AWS Lambda expects source code to be provided as a deployment package whose structure varies depending on which `runtime` is in use.
        See [Runtimes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_CreateFunction.html#SSS-CreateFunction-request-Runtime) for the valid values of `runtime`. The expected structure of the deployment package can be found in
        [the AWS Lambda documentation for each runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/deployment-package-v2.html).

        Once you have created your deployment package you can specify it either directly as a local file (using the `filename` argument) or
        indirectly via Amazon S3 (using the `s3_bucket`, `s3_key` and `s3_object_version` arguments). When providing the deployment
        package via S3 it may be useful to use the `s3.BucketObject` resource to upload it.

        For larger deployment packages it is recommended by Amazon to upload via S3, since the S3 API has better support for uploading
        large files efficiently.

        The **dead_letter_config** object supports the following:

          * `target_arn` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The ARN of an SNS topic or SQS queue to notify when an invocation fails. If this
            option is used, the function's IAM role must be granted suitable access to write to the target object,
            which means allowing either the `sns:Publish` or `sqs:SendMessage` action on this ARN, depending on
            which service is targeted.

        The **environment** object supports the following:

          * `variables` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - A map that defines environment variables for the Lambda function.

        The **tracing_config** object supports the following:

          * `mode` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Can be either `PassThrough` or `Active`. If PassThrough, Lambda will only trace
            the request from an upstream service if it contains a tracing header with
            "sampled=1". If Active, Lambda will respect any tracing header it receives
            from an upstream service. If no tracing header is received, Lambda will call
            X-Ray for a tracing decision.

        The **vpc_config** object supports the following:

          * `security_group_ids` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - A list of security group IDs associated with the Lambda function.
          * `subnet_ids` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - A list of subnet IDs associated with the Lambda function.

        :param pulumi.Input[dict] tags: A mapping of tags to assign to the object.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] timeout: The amount of time your Lambda Function has to run in seconds. Defaults to `3`. See [Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/limits.html)
        :param pulumi.Input[str] version: Latest published version of your Lambda Function.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] vpc_config: Provide this to allow your function to access your VPC. Fields documented below. See [Lambda in VPC](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/vpc.html)

        The **dead_letter_config** object supports the following:

          * `target_arn` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The ARN of an SNS topic or SQS queue to notify when an invocation fails. If this
            option is used, the function's IAM role must be granted suitable access to write to the target object,
            which means allowing either the `sns:Publish` or `sqs:SendMessage` action on this ARN, depending on
            which service is targeted.

        The **environment** object supports the following:

          * `variables` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - A map that defines environment variables for the Lambda function.

        The **tracing_config** object supports the following:

          * `mode` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Can be either `PassThrough` or `Active`. If PassThrough, Lambda will only trace
            the request from an upstream service if it contains a tracing header with
            "sampled=1". If Active, Lambda will respect any tracing header it receives
            from an upstream service. If no tracing header is received, Lambda will call
            X-Ray for a tracing decision.

        The **vpc_config** object supports the following:

          * `security_group_ids` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - A list of security group IDs associated with the Lambda function.
          * `subnet_ids` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - A list of subnet IDs associated with the Lambda function.
          * `vpc_id` (`pulumi.Input[str]`)
