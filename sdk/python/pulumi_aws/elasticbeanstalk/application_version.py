    Provides an Elastic Beanstalk Application Version Resource. Elastic Beanstalk allows
    you to deploy and manage applications in the AWS cloud without worrying about
    the infrastructure that runs those applications.
    
    This resource creates a Beanstalk Application Version that can be deployed to a Beanstalk
    Environment.
    
    ~> **NOTE on Application Version Resource:**  When using the Application Version resource with multiple 
    Elastic Beanstalk Environments it is possible that an error may be returned
    when attempting to delete an Application Version while it is still in use by a different environment.
    To work around this you can:
    <ol>
    <li>Create each environment in a separate AWS account</li>
    <li>Create your `aws_elastic_beanstalk_application_version` resources with a unique names in your 
    Elastic Beanstalk Application. For example &lt;revision&gt;-&lt;environment&gt;.</li>
