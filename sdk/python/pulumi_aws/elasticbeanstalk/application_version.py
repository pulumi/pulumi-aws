        Provides an Elastic Beanstalk Application Version Resource. Elastic Beanstalk allows
        you to deploy and manage applications in the AWS cloud without worrying about
        the infrastructure that runs those applications.

        This resource creates a Beanstalk Application Version that can be deployed to a Beanstalk
        Environment.

        > **NOTE on Application Version Resource:**  When using the Application Version resource with multiple 
        Elastic Beanstalk Environments it is possible that an error may be returned
        when attempting to delete an Application Version while it is still in use by a different environment.
        To work around this you can either create each environment in a separate AWS account or create your `elasticbeanstalk.ApplicationVersion` resources with a unique names in your Elastic Beanstalk Application. For example &lt;revision&gt;-&lt;environment&gt;.
