class Certificate(pulumi.CustomResource):
    """
    The ACM certificate resource allows requesting and management of certificates
    from the Amazon Certificate Manager.
    
    It deals with requesting certificates and managing their attributes and life-cycle.
    This resource does not deal with validation of a certificate but can provide inputs
    for other resources implementing the validation. It does not wait for a certificate to be issued.
    Use a `aws_acm_certificate_validation` resource for this.
    
    Most commonly, this resource is used to together with `aws_route53_record` and
    `aws_acm_certificate_validation` to request a DNS validated certificate,
    deploy the required validation records and wait for validation to complete.
    
    Domain validation through E-Mail is also supported but should be avoided as it requires a manual step outside
    of Terraform.
    
    It's recommended to specify `create_before_destroy = true` in a [lifecycle][1] block to replace a certificate
    which is currently in use (eg, by `aws_lb_listener`).
