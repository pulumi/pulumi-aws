A base policy is created and set to `LIVE` to allow attachments to the core network (e.g. VPC Attachments) before applying a policy document provided using the `aws.networkmanager.CoreNetworkPolicyAttachment` resource. This base policy is needed if your core network does not have any `LIVE` policies and your policy document has static routes pointing to VPC attachments and you want to attach your VPCs to the core network before applying the desired policy document. Valid values are `true` or `false`. An example of this Pulumi snippet can be found above for VPC Attachment in a single region and for VPC Attachment multi-region. An example base policy is shown below. This base policy is overridden with the policy that you specify in the `aws.networkmanager.CoreNetworkPolicyAttachment` resource.
