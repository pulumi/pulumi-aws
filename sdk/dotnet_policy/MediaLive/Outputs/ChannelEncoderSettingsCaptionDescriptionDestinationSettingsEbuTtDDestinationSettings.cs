The size is always set to 100% to allow the downstream player to choose the size. - Enter a list of font families, as a comma-separated list of font names, in order of preference. The name can be a font family (such as “Arial”), or a generic font family (such as “serif”), or “default” (to let the downstream player choose the font). - Leave blank to set the family to “monospace”.
