This only deletes objects when the bucket is destroyed, *not* when setting this parameter to `true`. Once this parameter is set to `true`, there must be a successful `pulumi up` run before a destroy is required to update this value in the resource state. Without a successful `pulumi up` after this parameter is set, this flag will have no effect. If setting this field in the same operation that would require replacing the bucket or destroying the bucket, this flag will not work. Additionally when importing a bucket, a successful `pulumi up` is required to set this value in state before it will take effect on a destroy operation.
