A client NID is a Lustre Network Identifier used to uniquely identify a client. You can specify the NID as either a single address or a range of addresses: 1. A single address is described in standard Lustre NID format by specifying the client’s IP address followed by the Lustre network ID (for example, 10.0.1.6{@literal @}tcp). 2. An address range is described using a dash to separate the range (for example, 10.0.[2-10].[1-255]{@literal @}tcp).
