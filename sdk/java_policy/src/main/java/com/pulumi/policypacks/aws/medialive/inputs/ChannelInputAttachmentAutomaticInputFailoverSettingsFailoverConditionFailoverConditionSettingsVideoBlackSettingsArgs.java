     * A value used in calculating the threshold below which MediaLive considers a pixel to be &#39;black&#39;. For the input to be considered black, every pixel in a frame must be below this threshold. The threshold is calculated as a percentage (expressed as a decimal) of white. Therefore .1 means 10% white (or 90% black). Note how the formula works for any color depth. For example, if you set this field to 0.1 in 10-bit color depth: (10230.1=102.3), which means a pixel value of 102 or less is &#39;black&#39;. If you set this field to .1 in an 8-bit color depth: (2550.1=25.5), which means a pixel value of 25 or less is &#39;black&#39;. The range is 0.0 to 1.0, with any number of decimal places.
