This isnâ€™t recommended, but it enables you to use certificates that are signed by private certificate authorities, or certificates that are self-signed. If enabled, API Gateway still performs basic certificate validation, which includes checking the certificate&#39;s expiration date, hostname, and presence of a root certificate authority. Supported only for `HTTP` and `HTTP_PROXY` integrations.
