    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Aws = Pulumi.Aws;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt;

    ///     var testEnvironmentEC2 = new Aws.Cloud9.EnvironmentEC2("testEnvironmentEC2", new()
    ///     {
    ///         InstanceType = "t2.micro",

    ///     var testUser = new Aws.Iam.User("testUser");
