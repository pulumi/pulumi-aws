Similarly, setting a left alignment will align captions to the bottom left of the output. If x and y positions are given in conjunction with the alignment parameter, the font will be justified (either left or centered) relative to those coordinates. Selecting “smart” justification will left-justify live subtitles and center-justify pre-recorded subtitles. This option is not valid for source captions that are STL or 608/embedded.
