    /// Provides an AWS EBS Volume Attachment as a top level resource, to attach and
    /// detach volumes from AWS Instances.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **NOTE on EBS block devices:** If you use `ebs_block_device` on an `aws.ec2.Instance`, this provider will assume management over the full set of non-root EBS block devices for the instance, and treats additional block devices as drift. For this reason, `ebs_block_device` cannot be mixed with external `aws.ebs.Volume` + `aws_ebs_volume_attachment` resources for a given instance.
