To manage changes and attachments of an EBS block to an instance, use the `aws.ebs.Volume` and `aws.ec2.VolumeAttachment` resources instead. If you use `EbsBlockDevice` on an `aws.ec2.Instance`, this provider will assume management over the full set of non-root EBS block devices for the instance, treating additional block devices as drift. For this reason, `EbsBlockDevice` cannot be mixed with external `aws.ebs.Volume` and `aws.ec2.VolumeAttachment` resources for a given instance.
