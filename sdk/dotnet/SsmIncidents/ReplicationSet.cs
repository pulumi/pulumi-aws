    /// 
    /// &gt; **NOTE:** Deleting a replication set also deletes all Incident Manager related data including response plans, incident records, contacts and escalation plans.

    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ### Basic Usage
    /// 
    /// Create a replication set.
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Aws = Pulumi.Aws;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var replicationSetName = new Aws.SsmIncidents.ReplicationSet("replicationSetName", new()

    ///         Regions = new[]
    ///         {
    ///             new Aws.SsmIncidents.Inputs.ReplicationSetRegionArgs
    ///             {
    ///                 Name = "us-west-2",
    ///             },
    ///         },
    ///         Tags =

    ///             { "exampleTag", "exampleValue" },
    ///         },
    ///     });
    /// 
    /// });
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// Add a Region to a replication set. (You can add only one Region at a time.)
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;

    /// 
    /// });
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// Delete a Region from a replication set. (You can delete only one Region at a time.)
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Aws = Pulumi.Aws;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt;
