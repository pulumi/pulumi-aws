    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ### Basic Usage
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Aws = Pulumi.Aws;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var example = new Aws.Iam.User("example", new()
    ///     {
    ///         Name = "example",
    ///     });
    /// 
    ///     var exampleServiceSpecificCredential = new Aws.Iam.ServiceSpecificCredential("example", new()
    ///     {
    ///         ServiceName = "codecommit.amazonaws.com",
    ///         UserName = example.Name,
    ///     });
    /// 
    /// });
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ### Bedrock API Key with Expiration
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Aws = Pulumi.Aws;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var example = new Aws.Iam.User("example", new()
    ///     {
    ///         Name = "example",
    ///     });
    /// 
    ///     var bedrock = new Aws.Iam.ServiceSpecificCredential("bedrock", new()

    ///

    /// $ pulumi import aws:iam/serviceSpecificCredential:ServiceSpecificCredential default `codecommit.amazonaws.com:example:some-id`
