Use the `allow_filter` setting if a segment has a well-defined group of other segments that connectivity should be restricted to. It is applied after routes have been shared in `segment_actions`. If a segment is listed in `allow_filter`, attachments between the two segments will have routes if they are also shared in the segment-actions area. For example, you might have a segment named "video-producer" that should only ever share routes with a "video-distributor" segment, no matter how many other share statements are created.

If a segment is listed in the `deny_filter`, attachments between the two segments will never have routes shared across them. For example, you might have a "financial" payment segment that should never share routes with a "development" segment, regardless of how many other share statements are created. Adding the payments segment to the deny-filter parameter prevents any shared routes from being created with other segments.
