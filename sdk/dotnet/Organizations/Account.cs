namespace Pulumi.Aws.Organizations
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Provides a resource to create a member account in the current organization.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** Account management must be done from the organization's root account.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note:** By default, deleting this resource will only remove an AWS account from an organization. You must set the `close_on_deletion` flag to true to close the account. It is worth noting that quotas are enforced when using the `close_on_deletion` argument, which can produce a [CLOSE_ACCOUNT_QUOTA_EXCEEDED](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/APIReference/API_CloseAccount.html) error, and require you to close the account manually.
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Aws = Pulumi.Aws;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var account = new Aws.Organizations.Account.Account("account", new()
    ///     {
    ///         Email = "john@doe.org",
    ///     });
    /// 
    /// });
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// Using `pulumi import`, import the AWS member account using the `account_id`. For example:
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    ///  $ pulumi import aws:organizations/account:Account my_account 111111111111
    /// ```
    ///  Certain resource arguments, like `role_name`, do not have an Organizations API method for reading the information after account creation. If the argument is set in the Pulumi program on an imported resource, Pulumi will always show a difference. To workaround this behavior, either omit the argument from the Pulumi program or use `ignore_changes` to hide the difference. For example:
    /// </summary>
    [AwsResourceType("aws:organizations/account:Account")]
