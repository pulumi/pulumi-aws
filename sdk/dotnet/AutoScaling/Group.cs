    /// ## Waiting for Capacity
    /// 
    /// A newly-created ASG is initially empty and begins to scale to `min_size` (or
    /// `desired_capacity`, if specified) by launching instances using the provided
    /// Launch Configuration. These instances take time to launch and boot.
    /// 
    /// On ASG Update, changes to these values also take time to result in the target
    /// number of instances providing service.
    /// 
    /// This provider provides two mechanisms to help consistently manage ASG scale up
    /// time across dependent resources.
    /// 
    /// #### Waiting for ASG Capacity
    /// 
    /// The first is default behavior. This provider waits after ASG creation for
    /// `min_size` (or `desired_capacity`, if specified) healthy instances to show up
    /// in the ASG before continuing.
    /// 
    /// If `min_size` or `desired_capacity` are changed in a subsequent update,
    /// this provider will also wait for the correct number of healthy instances before
    /// continuing.
    /// 
    /// This provider considers an instance "healthy" when the ASG reports `HealthStatus:
    /// "Healthy"` and `LifecycleState: "InService"`. See the [AWS AutoScaling
    /// Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/DeveloperGuide/AutoScalingGroupLifecycle.html)
    /// for more information on an ASG's lifecycle.
    /// 
    /// This provider will wait for healthy instances for up to
    /// `wait_for_capacity_timeout`. If ASG creation is taking more than a few minutes,
    /// it's worth investigating for scaling activity errors, which can be caused by
    /// problems with the selected Launch Configuration.
    /// 
    /// Setting `wait_for_capacity_timeout` to `"0"` disables ASG Capacity waiting.
    /// 
    /// #### Waiting for ELB Capacity
    /// 
    /// The second mechanism is optional, and affects ASGs with attached ELBs specified
    /// via the `load_balancers` attribute or with ALBs specified with `target_group_arns`.
    /// 
    /// The `min_elb_capacity` parameter causes this provider to wait for at least the
    /// requested number of instances to show up `"InService"` in all attached ELBs
    /// during ASG creation.  It has no effect on ASG updates.
    /// 
    /// If `wait_for_elb_capacity` is set, this provider will wait for exactly that number
    /// of Instances to be `"InService"` in all attached ELBs on both creation and
    /// updates.
    /// 
    /// These parameters can be used to ensure that service is being provided before
    /// this provider moves on. If new instances don't pass the ELB's health checks for any
    /// reason, the deployment will time out, and the ASG will be marked as
    /// tainted (i.e. marked to be destroyed in a follow up run).
    /// 
    /// As with ASG Capacity, this provider will wait for up to `wait_for_capacity_timeout`
    /// for the proper number of instances to be healthy.
    /// 
    /// #### Troubleshooting Capacity Waiting Timeouts
    /// 
    /// If ASG creation takes more than a few minutes, this could indicate one of a
    /// number of configuration problems. See the [AWS Docs on Load Balancer
    /// Troubleshooting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/elb-troubleshooting.html)
