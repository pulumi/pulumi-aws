    /// Provides a resource to manage AWS Device Farm Uploads.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **NOTE:** AWS currently has limited regional support for Device Farm (e.g., `us-west-2`). See [AWS Device Farm endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/devicefarm.html) for information on supported regions.
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Aws = Pulumi.Aws;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var exampleProject = new Aws.DeviceFarm.Project("exampleProject");
    /// 
    ///     var exampleUpload = new Aws.DeviceFarm.Upload("exampleUpload", new()
    ///     {
    ///         ProjectArn = exampleProject.Arn,
    ///         Type = "APPIUM_JAVA_TESTNG_TEST_SPEC",
    ///     });
    /// 
    /// });
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// Using `pulumi import`, import DeviceFarm Uploads using their ARN. For example:
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    ///  $ pulumi import aws:devicefarm/upload:Upload example arn:aws:devicefarm:us-west-2:123456789012:upload:4fa784c7-ccb4-4dbf-ba4f-02198320daa1
