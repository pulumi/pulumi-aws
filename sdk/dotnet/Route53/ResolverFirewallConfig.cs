    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Aws = Pulumi.Aws;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var example = new Aws.Ec2.Vpc("example", new()
    ///     {
    ///         CidrBlock = "10.0.0.0/16",
    ///         EnableDnsSupport = true,
    ///         EnableDnsHostnames = true,
    ///     });

    ///

    /// 
    /// ```sh
