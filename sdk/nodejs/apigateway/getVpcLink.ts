/**
 * Use this data source to get the id of a VPC Link in
 * API Gateway. To fetch the VPC Link you must provide a name to match against. 
 * As there is no unique name constraint on API Gateway VPC Links this data source will 
 * error if there is more than one match.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 * 
 * const aws_api_gateway_vpc_link_my_api_gateway_vpc_link = pulumi.output(aws.apigateway.getVpcLink({
 *     name: "my-vpc-link",
 * }));
 * ```
