/**
 * Use this data source to get the id and root_resource_id of a REST API in
 * API Gateway. To fetch the REST API you must provide a name to match against. 
 * As there is no unique name constraint on REST APIs this data source will 
 * error if there is more than one match.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 * 
 * const myRestApi = pulumi.output(aws.apigateway.getRestApi({
 *     name: "my-rest-api",
 * }));
 * ```
