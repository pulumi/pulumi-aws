/**
 * Manages S3 bucket-level Public Access Block configuration. For more information about these settings, see the [AWS S3 Block Public Access documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const exampleBucket = new aws.s3.Bucket("exampleBucket", {});
 * const exampleBucketPublicAccessBlock = new aws.s3.BucketPublicAccessBlock("exampleBucketPublicAccessBlock", {
 *     bucket: exampleBucket.id,
 *     blockPublicAcls: true,
 *     blockPublicPolicy: true,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * `aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block` can be imported by using the bucket name, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:s3/bucketPublicAccessBlock:BucketPublicAccessBlock example my-bucket
 * ```
