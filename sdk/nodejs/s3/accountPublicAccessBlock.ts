/**
 * Manages S3 account-level Public Access Block configuration. For more information about these settings, see the [AWS S3 Block Public Access documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html).
 * 
 * > **NOTE:** Each AWS account may only have one S3 Public Access Block configuration. Multiple configurations of the resource against the same AWS account will cause a perpetual difference.
 * 
 * > Advanced usage: To use a custom API endpoint for this Terraform resource, use the [`s3control` endpoint provider configuration](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/index.html#s3control), not the `s3` endpoint provider configuration.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 * 
 * const example = new aws.s3.AccountPublicAccessBlock("example", {
 *     blockPublicAcls: true,
 *     blockPublicPolicy: true,
 * });
 * ```
