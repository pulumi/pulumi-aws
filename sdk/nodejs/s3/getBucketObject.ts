/**
 * The S3 object data source allows access to the metadata and
 * _optionally_ (see below) content of an object stored inside S3 bucket.
 * 
 * > **Note:** The content of an object (`body` field) is available only for objects which have a human-readable `Content-Type` (`text/*` and `application/json`). This is to prevent printing unsafe characters and potentially downloading large amount of data which would be thrown away in favour of metadata.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * The following example retrieves a text object (which must have a `Content-Type`
 * value starting with `text/`) and uses it as the `userData` for an EC2 instance:
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 * 
 * const bootstrapScript = pulumi.output(aws.s3.getBucketObject({
 *     bucket: "ourcorp-deploy-config",
 *     key: "ec2-bootstrap-script.sh",
 * }));
 * const example = new aws.ec2.Instance("example", {
 *     ami: "ami-2757f631",
 *     instanceType: "t2.micro",
 *     userData: bootstrapScript.body,
 * });
 * ```
 * 
 * The following, more-complex example retrieves only the metadata for a zip
 * file stored in S3, which is then used to pass the most recent `versionId`
 * to AWS Lambda for use as a function implementation. More information about
 * Lambda functions is available in the documentation for
 * [`aws.lambda.Function`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/lambda_function.html).
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 * 
 * const lambda = pulumi.output(aws.s3.getBucketObject({
 *     bucket: "ourcorp-lambda-functions",
 *     key: "hello-world.zip",
 * }));
 * const testLambda = new aws.lambda.Function("testLambda", {
 *     handler: "exports.test",
 *     role: aws_iam_role_iam_for_lambda.arn, // (not shown)
 *     s3Bucket: lambda.bucket,
 *     s3Key: lambda.key,
 *     s3ObjectVersion: lambda.versionId,
 * });
 * ```
