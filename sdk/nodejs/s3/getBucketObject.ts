/**
 * The S3 object data source allows access to the metadata and
 * _optionally_ (see below) content of an object stored inside S3 bucket.
 *
 * > **Note:** The content of an object (`body` field) is available only for objects which have a human-readable `Content-Type` (`text/*` and `application/json`). This is to prevent printing unsafe characters and potentially downloading large amount of data which would be thrown away in favour of metadata.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 *
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const bootstrapScript = pulumi.output(aws.s3.getBucketObject({
 *     bucket: "ourcorp-deploy-config",
 *     key: "ec2-bootstrap-script.sh",
 * }, { async: true }));
 * const example = new aws.ec2.Instance("example", {
 *     ami: "ami-2757f631",
 *     instanceType: "t2.micro",
 *     userData: bootstrapScript.body,
 * });
 * ```
