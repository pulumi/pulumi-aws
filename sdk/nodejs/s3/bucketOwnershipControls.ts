/**
 * Provides a resource to manage S3 Bucket Ownership Controls. For more information, see the [S3 Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/about-object-ownership.html).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const exampleBucket = new aws.s3.Bucket("exampleBucket", {});
 * const exampleBucketOwnershipControls = new aws.s3.BucketOwnershipControls("exampleBucketOwnershipControls", {
 *     bucket: exampleBucket.id,
 *     rule: {
 *         objectOwnership: "BucketOwnerPreferred",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * S3 Bucket Ownership Controls can be imported using S3 Bucket name, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:s3/bucketOwnershipControls:BucketOwnershipControls example my-bucket
 * ```
