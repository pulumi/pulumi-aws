    /**
     * Creates an AWS/SNS metric with the requested [metricName]. See
     * https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-monitoring-using-cloudwatch.html for list of
     * all metric-names.
     *
     * Note, individual metrics can easily be obtained without supplying the name using the other
     * [metricXXX] functions.
     *
     * Amazon SNS and CloudWatch are integrated so you can collect, view, and analyze metrics for
     * every active Amazon SNS notification. Once you have configured CloudWatch for Amazon SNS, you
     * can gain better insight into the performance of your Amazon SNS topics, push notifications,
     * and SMS deliveries. For example, you can set an alarm to send you an email notification if a
     * specified threshold is met for an Amazon SNS metric, such as NumberOfNotificationsFailed.
     *
     * The metrics you configure with CloudWatch for your Amazon SNS topics are automatically
     * collected and pushed to CloudWatch every five minutes. These metrics are gathered on all
     * topics that meet the CloudWatch guidelines for being active. A topic is considered active by
     * CloudWatch for up to six hours from the last activity (i.e., any API call) on the topic.
     *
     * Amazon Simple Notification Service sends the following dimensions to CloudWatch:
     *
     * 1. "Application": Filters on application objects, which represent an app and device
     *    registered with one of the supported push notification services, such as APNS and FCM.
     * 2. "Application,Platform": Filters on application and platform objects, where the platform
     *    objects are for the supported push notification services, such as APNS and FCM.
     * 3. "Country": Filters on the destination country or region of an SMS message. The country or
     *    region is represented by its ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code.
     * 4. "Platform": Filters on platform objects for the push notification services, such as APNS
     *    and FCM.
     * 5. "TopicName": Filters on Amazon SNS topic names.
     * 6. "SMSType": Filters on the message type of SMS message. Can be "promotional" or
     *    "transactional".
