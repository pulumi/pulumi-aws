/**
 * Provides an SNS platform application resource
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) using certificate-based authentication
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const apnsApplication = new aws.sns.PlatformApplication("apns_application", {
 *     name: "apns_application",
 *     platform: "APNS",
 *     platformCredential: "<APNS PRIVATE KEY>",
 *     platformPrincipal: "<APNS CERTIFICATE>",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) using token-based authentication
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const apnsApplication = new aws.sns.PlatformApplication("apns_application", {
 *     name: "apns_application",
 *     platform: "APNS",
 *     platformCredential: "<APNS SIGNING KEY>",
 *     platformPrincipal: "<APNS SIGNING KEY ID>",
 *     applePlatformTeamId: "<APPLE TEAM ID>",
 *     applePlatformBundleId: "<APPLE BUNDLE ID>",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Google Cloud Messaging (GCM)
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const gcmApplication = new aws.sns.PlatformApplication("gcm_application", {
 *     name: "gcm_application",
 *     platform: "GCM",
 *     platformCredential: "<GCM API KEY>",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Using `pulumi import`, import SNS platform applications using the ARN. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import aws:sns/platformApplication:PlatformApplication gcm_application arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:app/GCM/gcm_application
 * ```
