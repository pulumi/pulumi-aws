 * Use this data source to get the ARN of a certificate in AWS Certificate
 * Manager (ACM), you can reference
 * it by domain without having to hard code the ARNs as input.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 * 
 * // Find a RSA 4096 bit certificate
 * const example = aws.acm.getCertificate({
 *     domain: "tf.example.com",
 *     keyTypes: ["RSA_4096"],
 * });
 * ```
