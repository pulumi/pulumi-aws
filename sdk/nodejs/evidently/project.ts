/**
 * Provides a CloudWatch Evidently Project resource.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.evidently.Project("example", {
 *     description: "Example Description",
 *     tags: {
 *         Key1: "example Project",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Store evaluation events in a CloudWatch Log Group
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.evidently.Project("example", {
 *     dataDelivery: {
 *         cloudwatchLogs: {
 *             logGroup: "example-log-group-name",
 *         },
 *     },
 *     description: "Example Description",
 *     tags: {
 *         Key1: "example Project",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Store evaluation events in an S3 bucket
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.evidently.Project("example", {
 *     dataDelivery: {
 *         s3Destination: {
 *             bucket: "example-bucket-name",
 *             prefix: "example",
 *         },
 *     },
 *     description: "Example Description",
 *     tags: {
 *         Key1: "example Project",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Using `pulumi import`, import CloudWatch Evidently Project using the `arn`. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:evidently/project:Project example arn:aws:evidently:us-east-1:123456789012:segment/example
 * ```
