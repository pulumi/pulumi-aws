/**
 * Provides a CloudWatch Evidently Launch resource.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.evidently.Launch("example", {
 *     name: "example",
 *     project: exampleAwsEvidentlyProject.name,
 *     groups: [{
 *         feature: exampleAwsEvidentlyFeature.name,
 *         name: "Variation1",
 *         variation: "Variation1",
 *     }],
 *     scheduledSplitsConfig: {
 *         steps: [{
 *             groupWeights: {
 *                 Variation1: 0,
