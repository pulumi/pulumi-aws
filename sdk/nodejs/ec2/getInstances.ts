/**
 * Use this data source to get IDs or IPs of Amazon EC2 instances to be referenced elsewhere,
 * e.g. to allow easier migration from another management solution
 * or to make it easier for an operator to connect through bastion host(s).
 *
 * > **Note:** It's strongly discouraged to use this data source for querying ephemeral
 * instances (e.g. managed via autoscaling group), as the output may change at any time
 * and you'd need to re-run `apply` every time an instance comes up or dies.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 *
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const testInstances = pulumi.output(aws.ec2.getInstances({
 *     filters: [{
 *         name: "instance.group-id",
 *         values: ["sg-12345678"],
 *     }],
 *     instanceStateNames: [
 *         "running",
 *         "stopped",
 *     ],
 *     instanceTags: {
 *         Role: "HardWorker",
 *     },
 * }, { async: true }));
 * const testEip: aws.ec2.Eip[] = [];
 * for (let i = 0; i < testInstances.apply(testInstances => testInstances.ids.length); i++) {
 *     testEip.push(new aws.ec2.Eip(`test-${i}`, {
 *         instance: testInstances.apply(testInstances => testInstances.ids[i]),
 *     }));
 * }
 * ```
