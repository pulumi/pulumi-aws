/**
 * Use this data source to get IDs or IPs of Amazon EC2 instances to be referenced elsewhere,
 * e.g. to allow easier migration from another management solution
 * or to make it easier for an operator to connect through bastion host(s).
 *
 * > **Note:** It's strongly discouraged to use this data source for querying ephemeral
 * instances (e.g. managed via autoscaling group), as the output may change at any time
 * and you'd need to re-run `apply` every time an instance comes up or dies.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * export = async () => {
 *     const testInstances = await aws.ec2.getInstances({
 *         instanceTags: {
 *             Role: "HardWorker",
 *         },
 *         filters: [{
 *             name: "instance.group-id",
 *             values: ["sg-12345678"],
 *         }],
 *         instanceStateNames: [
 *             "running",
 *             "stopped",
 *         ],
 *     });
 *     const testEip: aws.ec2.Eip[];
 *     for (const range = {value: 0}; range.value < testInstances.ids.length; range.value++) {
 *         testEip.push(new aws.ec2.Eip(`testEip-${range.value}`, {instance: testInstances.ids[range.value]}));
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
