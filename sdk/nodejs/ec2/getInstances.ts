/**
 * Use this data source to get IDs or IPs of Amazon EC2 instances to be referenced elsewhere,
 * e.g. to allow easier migration from another management solution
 * or to make it easier for an operator to connect through bastion host(s).
 * 
 * > **Note:** It's a best practice to expose instance details via [outputs](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/outputs.html)
 * and [remote state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/remote.html) and
 * **use [`terraform_remote_state`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/terraform/d/remote_state.html)
 * data source instead** if you manage referenced instances via Terraform.
 * 
 * > **Note:** It's strongly discouraged to use this data source for querying ephemeral
 * instances (e.g. managed via autoscaling group), as the output may change at any time
 * and you'd need to re-run `apply` every time an instance comes up or dies.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 * 
 * const aws_instances_test = pulumi.output(aws.ec2.getInstances({
 *     filters: [{
 *         name: "instance.group-id",
 *         values: ["sg-12345678"],
 *     }],
 *     instanceStateNames: [
 *         "running",
 *         "stopped",
 *     ],
 *     instanceTags: {
 *         Role: "HardWorker",
 *     },
 * }));
 * const aws_eip_test: aws.ec2.Eip[] = [];
 * for (let i = 0; i < aws_instances_test.apply(__arg0 => __arg0.ids.length); i++) {
 *     aws_eip_test.push(new aws.ec2.Eip(`test-${i}`, {
 *         instance: aws_instances_test.apply(__arg0 => __arg0.ids[i]),
 *     }));
 * }
 * ```
