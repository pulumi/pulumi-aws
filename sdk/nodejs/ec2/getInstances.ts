 * Use this data source to get IDs or IPs of Amazon EC2 instances to be referenced elsewhere,

 * or to make it easier for an operator to connect through bastion host(s).
 * 
 * -> **Note:** It's a best practice to expose instance details via [outputs](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/outputs.html)
 * and [remote state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/remote.html) and
 * **use [`terraform_remote_state`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/terraform/d/remote_state.html)
 * data source instead** if you manage referenced instances via Terraform.
 * 
 * ~> **Note:** It's strongly discouraged to use this data source for querying ephemeral
 * instances (e.g. managed via autoscaling group), as the output may change at any time
 * and you'd need to re-run `apply` every time an instance comes up or dies.
