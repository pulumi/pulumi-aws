/**
 * Provides an EC2 instance resource. This allows instances to be created, updated, and deleted.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Basic example using AMI lookup
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const ubuntu = aws.ec2.getAmi({
 *     mostRecent: true,
 *     filters: [
 *         {
 *             name: "name",
 *             values: ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*"],
 *         },
 *         {
 *             name: "virtualization-type",
 *             values: ["hvm"],
 *         },
 *     ],
 *     owners: ["099720109477"],
 * });
 * const web = new aws.ec2.Instance("web", {
 *     ami: ubuntu.then(ubuntu => ubuntu.id),
 *     instanceType: "t3.micro",
 *     tags: {
 *         Name: "HelloWorld",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Spot instance example
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const thisAmi = aws.ec2.getAmi({
 *     mostRecent: true,
 *     owners: ["amazon"],
 *     filters: [
 *         {
 *             name: "architecture",
 *             values: ["arm64"],
 *         },
 *         {
 *             name: "name",
 *             values: ["al2023-ami-2023*"],
 *         },
 *     ],
 * });
 * const thisInstance = new aws.ec2.Instance("thisInstance", {
 *     ami: thisAmi.then(thisAmi => thisAmi.id),
 *     instanceMarketOptions: {
 *         spotOptions: {
 *             maxPrice: "0.0031",
 *         },
 *     },
 *     instanceType: "t4g.nano",
 *     tags: {
 *         Name: "test-spot",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Network and credit specification example
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const myVpc = new aws.ec2.Vpc("myVpc", {
 *     cidrBlock: "172.16.0.0/16",
 *     tags: {
 *         Name: "tf-example",
 *     },
 * });
 * const mySubnet = new aws.ec2.Subnet("mySubnet", {
 *     vpcId: myVpc.id,
 *     cidrBlock: "172.16.10.0/24",
 *     availabilityZone: "us-west-2a",
 *     tags: {
 *         Name: "tf-example",
 *     },
 * });
 * const fooNetworkInterface = new aws.ec2.NetworkInterface("fooNetworkInterface", {
 *     subnetId: mySubnet.id,
 *     privateIps: ["172.16.10.100"],
 *     tags: {
 *         Name: "primary_network_interface",
 *     },
 * });
 * const fooInstance = new aws.ec2.Instance("fooInstance", {
 *     ami: "ami-005e54dee72cc1d00",
 *     instanceType: "t2.micro",
 *     networkInterfaces: [{
 *         networkInterfaceId: fooNetworkInterface.id,
 *         deviceIndex: 0,
 *     }],
 *     creditSpecification: {
 *         cpuCredits: "unlimited",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### CPU options example
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const exampleVpc = new aws.ec2.Vpc("exampleVpc", {
 *     cidrBlock: "172.16.0.0/16",
 *     tags: {
 *         Name: "tf-example",
 *     },
 * });
 * const exampleSubnet = new aws.ec2.Subnet("exampleSubnet", {
 *     vpcId: exampleVpc.id,
 *     cidrBlock: "172.16.10.0/24",
 *     availabilityZone: "us-east-2a",
 *     tags: {
 *         Name: "tf-example",
 *     },
 * });
 * const amzn-linux-2023-ami = aws.ec2.getAmi({
 *     mostRecent: true,
 *     owners: ["amazon"],
 *     filters: [{
 *         name: "name",
 *         values: ["al2023-ami-2023.*-x86_64"],
 *     }],
 * });
 * const exampleInstance = new aws.ec2.Instance("exampleInstance", {
 *     ami: amzn_linux_2023_ami.then(amzn_linux_2023_ami => amzn_linux_2023_ami.id),
 *     instanceType: "c6a.2xlarge",
 *     subnetId: exampleSubnet.id,
 *     cpuOptions: {
 *         coreCount: 2,
 *         threadsPerCore: 2,
 *     },
 *     tags: {
 *         Name: "tf-example",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Host resource group or Licence Manager registered AMI example
 *
 * A host resource group is a collection of Dedicated Hosts that you can manage as a single entity. As you launch instances, License Manager allocates the hosts and launches instances on them based on the settings that you configured. You can add existing Dedicated Hosts to a host resource group and take advantage of automated host management through License Manager.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** A dedicated host is automatically associated with a License Manager host resource group if **Allocate hosts automatically** is enabled. Otherwise, use the `hostResourceGroupArn` argument to explicitly associate the instance with the host resource group.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const _this = new aws.ec2.Instance("this", {
 *     ami: "ami-0dcc1e21636832c5d",
 *     hostResourceGroupArn: "arn:aws:resource-groups:us-west-2:012345678901:group/win-testhost",
 *     instanceType: "m5.large",
 *     tenancy: "host",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Using `pulumi import`, import instances using the `id`. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:ec2/instance:Instance web i-12345678
 * ```
 */
