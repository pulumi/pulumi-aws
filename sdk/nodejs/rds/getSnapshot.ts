/**
 * Use this data source to get information about a DB Snapshot for use when provisioning DB instances
 * 
 * > **NOTE:** This data source does not apply to snapshots created on Aurora DB clusters.
 * See the [`aws_db_cluster_snapshot` data source](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/d/db_cluster_snapshot.html) for DB Cluster snapshots.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 * 
 * const prod = new aws.rds.Instance("prod", {
 *     allocatedStorage: 10,
 *     dbSubnetGroupName: "my_database_subnet_group",
 *     engine: "mysql",
 *     engineVersion: "5.6.17",
 *     instanceClass: "db.t2.micro",
 *     name: "mydb",
 *     parameterGroupName: "default.mysql5.6",
 *     password: "bar",
 *     username: "foo",
 * });
 * const latestProdSnapshot = prod.id.apply(id => aws.rds.getSnapshot({
 *     dbInstanceIdentifier: id,
 *     mostRecent: true,
 * }));
 * // Use the latest production snapshot to create a dev instance.
 * const dev = new aws.rds.Instance("dev", {
 *     instanceClass: "db.t2.micro",
 *     name: "mydbdev",
 *     snapshotIdentifier: latestProdSnapshot.apply(latestProdSnapshot => latestProdSnapshot.id),
 * });
 * ```
