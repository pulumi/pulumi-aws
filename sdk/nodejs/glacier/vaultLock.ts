/**
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Testing Glacier Vault Lock Policy
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const exampleVault = new aws.glacier.Vault("example", {name: "example"});
 * const example = aws.iam.getPolicyDocumentOutput({
 *     statements: [{
 *         actions: ["glacier:DeleteArchive"],
 *         effect: "Deny",
 *         resources: [exampleVault.arn],
 *         conditions: [{
 *             test: "NumericLessThanEquals",
 *             variable: "glacier:ArchiveAgeinDays",
 *             values: ["365"],
 *         }],
 *     }],
 * });
 * const exampleVaultLock = new aws.glacier.VaultLock("example", {
 *     completeLock: false,
 *     policy: example.apply(example => example.json),
 *     vaultName: exampleVault.name,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Permanently Applying Glacier Vault Lock Policy
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.glacier.VaultLock("example", {
 *     completeLock: true,
 *     policy: exampleAwsIamPolicyDocument.json,
 *     vaultName: exampleAwsGlacierVault.name,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Using `pulumi import`, import Glacier Vault Locks using the Glacier Vault name. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import aws:glacier/vaultLock:VaultLock example example-vault
 * ```
