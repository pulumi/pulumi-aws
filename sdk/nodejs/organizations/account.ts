/**
 * Provides a resource to create a member account in the current organization.
 *
 * > **Note:** Account management must be done from the organization's root account.
 *
 * > **Note:** By default, deleting this resource will only remove an AWS account from an organization. You must set the `closeOnDeletion` flag to true to close the account. It is worth noting that quotas are enforced when using the `closeOnDeletion` argument, which can produce a [CLOSE_ACCOUNT_QUOTA_EXCEEDED](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/APIReference/API_CloseAccount.html) error, and require you to close the account manually.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const account = new aws.organizations.Account("account", {
 *     name: "my_new_account",
 *     email: "john@doe.org",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ### Identity Schema
 *
 * #### Required
 *
 * * `id` (String) ID of the AWS Organizations account.
 *
 * #### Optional
 *
 * * `account_id` (String) AWS Account where this resource is managed.
 *
 * Using `pulumi import`, import the AWS member account using the `account_id`. For example:
 *
 * console
 *
 * % pulumi import aws_organizations_account.example 111111111111
 *
 * To import accounts that have set iam_user_access_to_billing, use the following:
 *
 * console
 *
 * % pulumi import aws_organizations_account.example 111111111111_ALLOW
 *
 * Certain resource arguments, like `role_name`, do not have an Organizations API method for reading the information after account creation. If the argument is set in the Pulumi program on an imported resource, Pulumi will always show a difference. To workaround this behavior, either omit the argument from the Pulumi program or use `ignore_changes` to hide the difference. For example:
 *
 * terraform
 *
 * resource "aws_organizations_account" "account" {
 *
 *   name      = "my_new_account"
 *
 *   email     = "john@doe.org"
 *
 *   role_name = "myOrganizationRole"
 *
 * # There is no AWS Organizations API for reading role_name
 *
 *   lifecycle {
 *
 *     ignore_changes = [role_name]
 *
 *   }
 *
 * }
