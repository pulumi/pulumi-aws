/**
 * Get information about the organization that the users account belongs to.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Basic Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = aws.organizations.getOrganization({});
 * export const accountIds = example.then(example => example.accounts.map(__item => __item.id));
 * ```
 *
 * ### Limit SNS Topic Access to an Organization
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = aws.organizations.getOrganization({});
 * const snsTopic = new aws.sns.Topic("sns_topic", {name: "my-sns-topic"});
 * const snsTopicPolicy = pulumi.all([example, snsTopic.arn]).apply(([example, arn]) => aws.iam.getPolicyDocumentOutput({
 *     statements: [{
 *         effect: "Allow",
