/**
 * Get information about the organization that the user's account belongs to
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### List all account IDs for the organization
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = aws.organizations.getOrganization({});
 * export const accountIds = example.then(example => example.accounts.map(__item => __item.id));
 * ```
 *
 * ### SNS topic that can be interacted by the organization only
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = pulumi.output(aws.organizations.getOrganization({ async: true }));
 * const snsTopic = new aws.sns.Topic("sns_topic", {});
 * const snsTopicPolicyPolicyDocument = pulumi.all([example, snsTopic.arn]).apply(([example, arn]) => aws.iam.getPolicyDocument({
 *     statements: [{
 *         actions: [
 *             "SNS:Subscribe",
 *             "SNS:Publish",
 *         ],
 *         conditions: [{
 *             test: "StringEquals",
 *             values: [example.id],
 *             variable: "aws:PrincipalOrgID",
 *         }],
 *         effect: "Allow",
 *         principals: [{
 *             identifiers: ["*"],
 *             type: "AWS",
 *         }],
 *         resources: [arn],
 *     }],
 * }, { async: true }));
 * const snsTopicPolicyTopicPolicy = new aws.sns.TopicPolicy("sns_topic_policy", {
 *     arn: snsTopic.arn,
 *     policy: snsTopicPolicyPolicyDocument.json,
 * });
 * ```
