// @pulumi/aws (and submodules) is a deployment-only module.  If someone tries to capture it, and we
// fail for some reason we want to give a good message about what the problem likely is.  Note that
// capturing a deployment time module can be ok in some cases.  For example, using "aws.sdk" is
// fine, and will give runtime access to the right awssdk API. This will ensure that those 'safe to
// serialize' values are captured 'by-value' However, in general, the majority of this API is not
// safe to use at 'run time' and will fail.

// Now, export a 'sdk' property that provides access to the the aws nodejs sdk.  Note that we're
// exporting *both* the value *and* namespace side.  That's why we need `typeof import("aws-sdk")`
// (which gives the entire share of that module).
//
// With this downstream clients can now write the following in an lambda:
//
//      import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
//      ...
//      /* inside a lambda now: */
//      const client = new aws.sdk.DynamoDB.DocumentClient(/*opt-args*/);
//
// Inside the serialized lambda for the above, 'sdk' will be a property with a getter function
// that ends up returning `require("aws-sdk")` inside of it.

// itself.  If we exported that module, serialization would either try to actually serialize it
// (bad), or it would try to reference it through the aws node_modules path (also bad).  We don't
// want either of these.  Instead, we want the serialized code to literally contain
//
//      `return require("aws-sdk")...`
//
// By defining things in this way, that require ends up having no impact on closure serialization or
// modules-inclusion.  Instead, if just emits code that works correctly in AWS lambda due to
// 'aws-sdk' being a well known node-module that is always available. import * as pulumiDynamoDB
