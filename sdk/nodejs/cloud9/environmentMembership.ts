/**
 * Provides an environment member to an AWS Cloud9 development environment.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const test = new aws.cloud9.EnvironmentEC2("test", {
 *     instanceType: "t2.micro",
 *     name: "some-env",
 * });
 * const testUser = new aws.iam.User("test", {name: "some-user"});
 * const testEnvironmentMembership = new aws.cloud9.EnvironmentMembership("test", {
 *     environmentId: test.id,
 *     permissions: "read-only",
 *     userArn: testUser.arn,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Using `pulumi import`, import Cloud9 environment membership using the `environment-id#user-arn`. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:cloud9/environmentMembership:EnvironmentMembership test environment-id#user-arn
 * ```
