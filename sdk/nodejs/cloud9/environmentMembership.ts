/**
 * Provides an environment member to an AWS Cloud9 development environment.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const testEnvironmentEC2 = new aws.cloud9.EnvironmentEC2("testEnvironmentEC2", {instanceType: "t2.micro"});
 * const testUser = new aws.iam.User("testUser", {});
 * const testEnvironmentMembership = new aws.cloud9.EnvironmentMembership("testEnvironmentMembership", {
 *     environmentId: testEnvironmentEC2.id,
 *     permissions: "read-only",
 *     userArn: testUser.arn,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * In TODO v1.5.0 and later, use an `import` block to import Cloud9 environment membership using the `environment-id#user-arn`. For exampleterraform import {
 *
 *  to = aws_cloud9_environment_membership.test
 *
 *  id = "environment-id#user-arn" } Using `TODO import`, import Cloud9 environment membership using the `environment-id#user-arn`. For exampleconsole % TODO import aws_cloud9_environment_membership.test environment-id#user-arn
