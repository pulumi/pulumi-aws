/**
 * The CloudFormation Export data source allows access to stack
 * exports specified in the [Output](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/outputs-section-structure.html) section of the Cloudformation Template using the optional Export Property.
 * 
 *  > Note: If you are trying to use a value from a Cloudformation Stack in the same Terraform run please use normal interpolation or Cloudformation Outputs. 
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 * 
 * const subnetId = pulumi.output(aws.cloudformation.getExport({
 *     name: "mySubnetIdExportName",
 * }));
 * const web = new aws.ec2.Instance("web", {
 *     ami: "ami-abb07bcb",
 *     instanceType: "t1.micro",
 *     subnetId: subnetId.apply(subnetId => subnetId.value),
 * });
 * ```
