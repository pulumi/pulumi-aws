 * This resource can be used to get a set of license ARNs matching a filter.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * The following shows getting all license ARNs issued from the AWS marketplace. Providing no filter, would provide all license ARNs for the entire account.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const test = aws.licensemanager.getReceivedLicenses({
 *     filters: [{
 *         name: "IssuerName",
 *         values: ["AWS/Marketplace"],
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
