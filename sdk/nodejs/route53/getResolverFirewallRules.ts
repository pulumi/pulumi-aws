/**
 * `aws.route53.getResolverFirewallRules` Provides details about rules in a specific Route53 Resolver Firewall rule group.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * The following example shows how to get Route53 Resolver Firewall rules based on its associated firewall group id.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = aws.route53.getResolverFirewallRules({
 *     firewallRuleGroupId: aws_route53_resolver_firewall_rule_group.example.id,
 * });
 * ```
