/**
 * Provides a Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall rule group resource.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.route53.ResolverFirewallRuleGroup("example", {});
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 *  Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall rule groups can be imported using the Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall rule group ID, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:route53/resolverFirewallRuleGroup:ResolverFirewallRuleGroup example rslvr-frg-0123456789abcdef
 * ```
