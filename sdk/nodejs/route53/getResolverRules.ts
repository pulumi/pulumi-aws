/**
 * `aws.route53.getResolverRules` provides details about a set of Route53 Resolver rules.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * Retrieving the default resolver rule.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = pulumi.output(aws.route53.getResolverRules({
 *     ownerId: "Route 53 Resolver",
 *     ruleType: "RECURSIVE",
 *     shareStatus: "NOT_SHARED",
 * }, { async: true }));
 * ```
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = pulumi.output(aws.route53.getResolverRules({
 *     ruleType: "FORWARD",
 *     shareStatus: "SHARED_WITH_ME",
 * }, { async: true }));
