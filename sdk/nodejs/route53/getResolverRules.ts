/**
 * `aws.route53.getResolverRules` provides details about a set of Route53 Resolver rules.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * The following example shows how to get Route53 Resolver rules based on tags.
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 * 
 * const example = aws.route53.getResolverRules({
 *     tags: [{
