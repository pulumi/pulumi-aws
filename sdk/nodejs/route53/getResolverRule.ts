/**
 * `aws.route53.ResolverRule` provides details about a specific Route53 Resolver rule.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * The following example shows how to get a Route53 Resolver rule based on its associated domain name and rule type.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = pulumi.output(aws.route53.getResolverRule({
 *     domainName: "subdomain.example.com",
 *     ruleType: "SYSTEM",
 * }, { async: true }));
 * ```
