/**
 * Provides a Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall config resource.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.ec2.Vpc("example", {
 *     cidrBlock: "10.0.0.0/16",
 *     enableDnsSupport: true,
 *     enableDnsHostnames: true,
 * });
 * const exampleResolverFirewallConfig = new aws.route53.ResolverFirewallConfig("example", {
 *     resourceId: example.id,
 *     firewallFailOpen: "ENABLED",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Using `pulumi import`, import Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall configs using the Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall config ID. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import aws:route53/resolverFirewallConfig:ResolverFirewallConfig example rdsc-be1866ecc1683e95
 * ```
