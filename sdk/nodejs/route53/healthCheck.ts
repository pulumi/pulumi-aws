/**
 * Provides a Route53 health check.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Connectivity and HTTP Status Code Check
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.route53.HealthCheck("example", {
 *     fqdn: "example.com",
 *     port: 80,
 *     type: "HTTP",
 *     resourcePath: "/",
 *     failureThreshold: 5,
 *     requestInterval: 30,
 *     tags: {
 *         Name: "tf-test-health-check",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Connectivity and String Matching Check
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.route53.HealthCheck("example", {
 *     failureThreshold: 5,
 *     fqdn: "example.com",
 *     port: 443,
 *     requestInterval: 30,
 *     resourcePath: "/",
 *     searchString: "example",
 *     type: "HTTPS_STR_MATCH",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Aggregate Check
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const parent = new aws.route53.HealthCheck("parent", {
 *     type: "CALCULATED",
 *     childHealthThreshold: 1,
 *     childHealthchecks: [child.id],
 *     tags: {
 *         Name: "tf-test-calculated-health-check",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### CloudWatch Alarm Check
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const foobar = new aws.cloudwatch.MetricAlarm("foobar", {
 *     name: "test-foobar5",
 *     comparisonOperator: "GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold",
 *     evaluationPeriods: 2,
 *     metricName: "CPUUtilization",
 *     namespace: "AWS/EC2",
 *     period: 120,
 *     statistic: "Average",
 *     threshold: 80,
 *     alarmDescription: "This metric monitors ec2 cpu utilization",
 * });
 * const foo = new aws.route53.HealthCheck("foo", {
 *     type: "CLOUDWATCH_METRIC",
 *     cloudwatchAlarmName: foobar.name,
 *     cloudwatchAlarmRegion: "us-west-2",
 *     insufficientDataHealthStatus: "Healthy",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### CloudWatch Alarm Check With Triggers
 *
 * The `triggers` argument allows the Route53 health check to be synchronized when a change to the upstream CloudWatch alarm is made.
 * In the configuration below, the health check will be synchronized any time the `threshold` of the alarm is changed.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.cloudwatch.MetricAlarm("example", {
 *     name: "example",
 *     comparisonOperator: "GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold",
 *     evaluationPeriods: 2,
 *     metricName: "CPUUtilization",
 *     namespace: "AWS/EC2",
 *     period: 120,
 *     statistic: "Average",
 *     threshold: 80,
 *     alarmDescription: "This metric monitors ec2 cpu utilization",
 * });
 * const exampleHealthCheck = new aws.route53.HealthCheck("example", {
 *     type: "CLOUDWATCH_METRIC",
 *     cloudwatchAlarmName: example.name,
 *     cloudwatchAlarmRegion: "us-west-2",
 *     insufficientDataHealthStatus: "Healthy",
 *     triggers: {
 *         threshold: example.threshold,
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Using `pulumi import`, import Route53 Health Checks using the health check `id`. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import aws:route53/healthCheck:HealthCheck http_check abcdef11-2222-3333-4444-555555fedcba
 * ```
