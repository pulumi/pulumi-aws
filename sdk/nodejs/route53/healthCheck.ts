/**
 * Provides a Route53 health check.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * ### Connectivity and HTTP Status Code Check
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 * 
 * const example = new aws.route53.HealthCheck("example", {
 *     failureThreshold: 5,
 *     fqdn: "example.com",
 *     port: 80,
 *     requestInterval: 30,
 *     resourcePath: "/",
 *     tags: {
 *         Name: "tf-test-health-check",
 *     },
 *     type: "HTTP",
 * });
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Connectivity and String Matching Check
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 * 
 * const example = new aws.route53.HealthCheck("example", {
 *     failureThreshold: 5,
 *     fqdn: "example.com",
 *     port: 443,
 *     requestInterval: 30,
 *     resourcePath: "/",
 *     searchString: "example",
 *     type: "HTTPS_STR_MATCH",
 * });
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Aggregate Check
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 * 
 * const parent = new aws.route53.HealthCheck("parent", {
 *     childHealthThreshold: 1,
 *     childHealthchecks: [aws_route53_health_check_child.id],
 *     tags: {
 *         Name: "tf-test-calculated-health-check",
 *     },
 *     type: "CALCULATED",
 * });
 * ```
 * 
 * ### CloudWatch Alarm Check
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 * 
 * const foobar = new aws.cloudwatch.MetricAlarm("foobar", {
 *     alarmDescription: "This metric monitors ec2 cpu utilization",
 *     name: "terraform-test-foobar5",
 *     comparisonOperator: "GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold",
 *     evaluationPeriods: 2,
 *     metricName: "CPUUtilization",
 *     namespace: "AWS/EC2",
 *     period: 120,
 *     statistic: "Average",
 *     threshold: 80,
 * });
 * const foo = new aws.route53.HealthCheck("foo", {
 *     cloudwatchAlarmName: foobar.alarmName,
 *     cloudwatchAlarmRegion: "us-west-2",
 *     insufficientDataHealthStatus: "Healthy",
 *     type: "CLOUDWATCH_METRIC",
 * });
 * ```
