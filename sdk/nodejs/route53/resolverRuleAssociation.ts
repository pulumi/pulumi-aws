/**
 * Provides a Route53 Resolver rule association.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.route53.ResolverRuleAssociation("example", {
 *     resolverRuleId: aws_route53_resolver_rule.sys.id,
 *     vpcId: aws_vpc.foo.id,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Route53 Resolver rule associations can be imported using the `id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:route53/resolverRuleAssociation:ResolverRuleAssociation example rslvr-rrassoc-97242eaf88example
 * ```
