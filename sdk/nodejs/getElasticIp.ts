/**
 * `aws.ec2.Eip` provides details about a specific Elastic IP.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Search By Allocation ID (VPC only)
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const byAllocationId = pulumi.output(aws.getElasticIp({
 *     id: "eipalloc-12345678",
 * }, { async: true }));
 * ```
 * ### Search By Filters (EC2-Classic or VPC)
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const byFilter = pulumi.output(aws.getElasticIp({
 *     filters: [{
 *         name: "tag:Name",
 *         values: ["exampleNameTagValue"],
 *     }],
 * }, { async: true }));
 * ```
 * ### Search By Public IP (EC2-Classic or VPC)
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const byPublicIp = pulumi.output(aws.getElasticIp({
 *     publicIp: "1.2.3.4",
 * }, { async: true }));
 * ```
 * ### Search By Tags (EC2-Classic or VPC)
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const byTags = pulumi.output(aws.getElasticIp({
 *     tags: {
 *         Name: "exampleNameTagValue",
 *     },
 * }, { async: true }));
 * ```
