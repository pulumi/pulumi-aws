/**
 * `aws_availability_zone` provides details about a specific availability zone (AZ)
 * in the current region.
 * 
 * This can be used both to validate an availability zone given in a variable
 * and to split the AZ name into its component parts of an AWS region and an
 * AZ identifier letter. The latter may be useful e.g. for implementing a
 * consistent subnet numbering scheme across several regions by mapping both
 * the region and the subnet letter to network numbers.
 * 
 * This is different from the `aws_availability_zones` (plural) data source,
 * which provides a list of the available zones.
