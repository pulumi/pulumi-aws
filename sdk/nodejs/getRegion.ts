/**
 * `aws_region` provides details about a specific AWS region.
 * 
 * As well as validating a given region name this resource can be used to
 * discover the name of the region configured within the provider. The latter
 * can be useful in a child module which is inheriting an AWS provider
 * configuration from its parent module.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * The following example shows how the resource might be used to obtain
 * the name of the AWS region configured on the provider.
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 * 
 * const current = pulumi.output(aws.getRegion({}));
 * ```
