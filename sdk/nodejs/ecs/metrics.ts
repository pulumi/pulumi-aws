     * You can monitor your Amazon ECS resources using Amazon CloudWatch, which collects and processes
     * raw data from Amazon ECS into readable, near real-time metrics. These statistics are recorded for
     * a period of two weeks so that you can access historical information and gain a better perspective
     * on how your clusters or services are performing. Amazon ECS metric data is automatically sent to
     * CloudWatch in 1-minute periods. For more information about CloudWatch, see the
     * [Amazon-CloudWatch-User-Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/).

     * Amazon ECS metrics use the AWS/ECS namespace and provide metrics for the following dimensions.
     * 1. "ClusterName": This dimension filters the data that you request for all resources in a
     *    specified cluster. All Amazon ECS metrics are filtered by ClusterName.
     * 2. "ServiceName": This dimension filters the data that you request for all resources in a
     *    specified service within a specified cluster.
