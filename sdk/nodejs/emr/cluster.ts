/**
 * Provides an Elastic MapReduce Cluster, a web service that makes it easy to
 * process large amounts of data efficiently. See [Amazon Elastic MapReduce Documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/elastic-mapreduce/)
 * for more information.
 * 
 * To configure [Instance Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-instance-group-configuration.html#emr-plan-instance-groups) for [task nodes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-master-core-task-nodes.html#emr-plan-task), see the [`aws.emr.InstanceGroup` resource](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/emr_instance_group.html).
 * 
 * > Support for [Instance Fleets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-instance-group-configuration.html#emr-plan-instance-fleets) will be made available in an upcoming release.
 *

 * 
 * The `aws.emr.Cluster` resource typically requires two IAM roles, one for the EMR Cluster
 * to use as a service, and another to place on your Cluster Instances to interact
 * with AWS from those instances. The suggested role policy template for the EMR service is `AmazonElasticMapReduceRole`,
 * and `AmazonElasticMapReduceforEC2Role` for the EC2 profile. See the [Getting
 * Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-gs-launch-sample-cluster.html)
 * guide for more information on these IAM roles. There is also a fully-bootable
 * example this provider configuration at the bottom of this page.
 * 
 * ### Enable Debug Logging
 * 
 * [Debug logging in EMR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-plan-debugging.html)
 * is implemented as a step. It is highly recommended to utilize the
 * [lifecycle configuration block](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html) with `ignoreChanges` if other
 * steps are being managed outside of this provider.
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 * 
 * const example = new aws.emr.Cluster("example", {
 *     steps: [{
 *         actionOnFailure: "TERMINATE_CLUSTER",
 *         hadoopJarStep: {
 *             args: ["state-pusher-script"],
 *             jar: "command-runner.jar",
 *         },
 *         name: "Setup Hadoop Debugging",
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Multiple Node Master Instance Group
 * 
 * Available in EMR version 5.23.0 and later, an EMR Cluster can be launched with three master nodes for high availability. Additional information about this functionality and its requirements can be found in the [EMR Management Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-plan-ha.html).
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 * 
 * // Map public IP on launch must be enabled for public (Internet accessible) subnets
 * const exampleSubnet = new aws.ec2.Subnet("example", {
 *     mapPublicIpOnLaunch: true,
 * });
 * const exampleCluster = new aws.emr.Cluster("example", {
 *     // coreInstanceGroup must be configured
 *     coreInstanceGroup: {},
 *     ec2Attributes: {
 *         subnetId: exampleSubnet.id,
 *     },
 *     masterInstanceGroup: {
 *         // Master instance count must be set to 3
 *         instanceCount: 3,
 *     },
 *     // EMR version must be 5.23.0 or later
 *     releaseLabel: "emr-5.24.1",
 *     // Termination protection is automatically enabled for multiple masters
 *     // To destroy the cluster, this must be configured to false and applied first
 *     terminationProtection: true,
 * });
 * ```
 * 
 * ## coreInstanceGroup Configuration Block
 * 
 * Supported arguments for the `coreInstanceGroup` configuration block:
 * 
 * * `instanceType` - (Required) EC2 instance type for all instances in the instance group.
 * * `autoscalingPolicy` - (Optional) String containing the [EMR Auto Scaling Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-automatic-scaling.html) JSON.
 * * `bidPrice` - (Optional) Bid price for each EC2 instance in the instance group, expressed in USD. By setting this attribute, the instance group is being declared as a Spot Instance, and will implicitly create a Spot request. Leave this blank to use On-Demand Instances.
 * * `ebsConfig` - (Optional) Configuration block(s) for EBS volumes attached to each instance in the instance group. Detailed below.
 * * `instanceCount` - (Optional) Target number of instances for the instance group. Must be at least 1. Defaults to 1.
 * * `name` - (Optional) Friendly name given to the instance group.
 * 
 * ## ec2Attributes
 * 
 * Attributes for the Amazon EC2 instances running the job flow
 * 
 * * `keyName` - (Optional) Amazon EC2 key pair that can be used to ssh to the master node as the user called `hadoop`
 * * `subnetId` - (Optional) VPC subnet id where you want the job flow to launch. Cannot specify the `cc1.4xlarge` instance type for nodes of a job flow launched in a Amazon VPC
 * * `additionalMasterSecurityGroups` - (Optional) String containing a comma separated list of additional Amazon EC2 security group IDs for the master node
 * * `additionalSlaveSecurityGroups` - (Optional) String containing a comma separated list of additional Amazon EC2 security group IDs for the slave nodes as a comma separated string
 * * `emrManagedMasterSecurityGroup` - (Optional) Identifier of the Amazon EC2 EMR-Managed security group for the master node
 * * `emrManagedSlaveSecurityGroup` - (Optional) Identifier of the Amazon EC2 EMR-Managed security group for the slave nodes
 * * `serviceAccessSecurityGroup` - (Optional) Identifier of the Amazon EC2 service-access security group - required when the cluster runs on a private subnet
 * * `instanceProfile` - (Required) Instance Profile for EC2 instances of the cluster assume this role
 * 
 * > **NOTE on EMR-Managed security groups:** These security groups will have any
 * missing inbound or outbound access rules added and maintained by AWS, to ensure
 * proper communication between instances in a cluster. The EMR service will
 * maintain these rules for groups provided in `emrManagedMasterSecurityGroup`
 * and `emrManagedSlaveSecurityGroup`; attempts to remove the required rules
 * may succeed, only for the EMR service to re-add them in a matter of minutes.
 * This may cause this provider to fail to destroy an environment that contains an EMR
 * cluster, because the EMR service does not revoke rules added on deletion,
 * leaving a cyclic dependency between the security groups that prevents their
 * deletion. To avoid this, use the `revokeRulesOnDelete` optional attribute for
 * any Security Group used in `emrManagedMasterSecurityGroup` and
 * `emrManagedSlaveSecurityGroup`. See [Amazon EMR-Managed Security
 * Groups](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-man-sec-groups.html)
 * for more information about the EMR-managed security group rules.
 * 
 * ## kerberosAttributes

 * * `crossRealmTrustPrincipalPassword` - (Optional) Required only when establishing a cross-realm trust with a KDC in a different realm. The cross-realm principal password, which must be identical across realms. This provider cannot perform drift detection of this configuration.
 * * `kdcAdminPassword` - (Required) The password used within the cluster for the kadmin service on the cluster-dedicated KDC, which maintains Kerberos principals, password policies, and keytabs for the cluster. This provider cannot perform drift detection of this configuration.

 * * `bidPrice` - (Optional) If set, the bid price for each EC2 instance in the instance group, expressed in USD. By setting this attribute, the instance group is being declared as a Spot Instance, and will implicitly create a Spot request. Leave this blank to use On-Demand Instances.
 * * `ebsConfig` - (Optional) A list of attributes for the EBS volumes attached to each instance in the instance group. Each `ebsConfig` defined will result in additional EBS volumes being attached to _each_ instance in the instance group. Defined below

 * * `ebsConfig` - (Optional) Configuration block(s) for EBS volumes attached to each instance in the instance group. Detailed below.
 * * `instanceCount` - (Optional) Target number of instances for the instance group. Must be 1 or 3. Defaults to 1. Launching with multiple master nodes is only supported in EMR version 5.23.0+, and requires this resource's `coreInstanceGroup` to be configured.
