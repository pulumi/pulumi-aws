/**
 * Attaches a policy to a KMS Key.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.kms.Key("example", {description: "example"});
 * const exampleKeyPolicy = new aws.kms.KeyPolicy("example", {
 *     keyId: example.id,
 *     policy: JSON.stringify({
 *         Id: "example",
 *         Statement: [{
 *             Action: "kms:*",
 *             Effect: "Allow",
 *             Principal: {
 *                 AWS: "*",
 *             },
 *             Resource: "*",
 *             Sid: "Enable IAM User Permissions",
 *         }],
 *         Version: "2012-10-17",
 *     }),
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Using `pulumi import`, import KMS Key Policies using the `key_id`. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import aws:kms/keyPolicy:KeyPolicy a 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
 * ```
