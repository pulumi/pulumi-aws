/**
 * Use the Principal element to specify the user (IAM user, federated user, or assumed-role user), AWS account, AWS
 * service, or other principal entity that is allowed or denied access to a resource. You use the Principal element in
 * the trust policies for IAM roles and in resource-based policiesâ€”that is, in policies that you embed directly in a
 * resource. For example, you can embed such policies in an Amazon S3 bucket, an Amazon Glacier vault, an Amazon SNS
 * topic, an Amazon SQS queue, or an AWS KMS customer master key (CMK).
 *
 * Use the Principal element in these ways:
 *
 *     - In IAM roles, use the Principal element in the role's trust policy to specify who can assume the role. For
 *       cross-account access, you must specify the 12-digit identifier of the trusted account.
 *
 *       Note: After you create the role, you can change the account to "*" to allow everyone to assume the role. If
 *       you do this, we strongly recommend that you limit who can access the role through other means, such as a
 *       Condition element that limits access to only certain IP addresses. Do not leave your role accessible to
 *       everyone!
 *
 *     - In resource-based policies, use the Principal element to specify the accounts or users who are allowed to
 *       access the resource.
 *
 * Do not use the Principal element in policies that you attach to IAM users and groups. Similarly, you do not specify
 * a principal in the permission policy for an IAM role. In those cases, the principal is implicitly the user that the
 * policy is attached to (for IAM users) or the user who assumes the role (for role access policies). When the policy
 * is attached to an IAM group, the principal is the IAM user in that group who is making the request.
