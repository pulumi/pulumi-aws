/**
 * Amazon ECR lifecycle policies enable you to specify the lifecycle management of images in a repository.
 * A lifecycle policy is a set of one or more rules, where each rule defines an action for Amazon ECR.
 * The actions apply to images that contain tags prefixed with the given strings. This allows the automation
 * of cleaning up unused images, for example expiring images based on age or count. You should expect that
 * after creating a lifecycle policy the affected images are expired within 24 hours.
 *
 * For more details about ECR lifecycle policies, please refer to the AWS documentation online:
 * https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/LifecyclePolicies.html
