     * [metricXXX] functions.
     *
     * Amazon CloudWatch enables you to retrieve statistics as an ordered set of time-series data, known
     * as metrics. You can use these metrics to verify that your system is performing as expected.
     *
     * Amazon EC2 sends metrics to CloudWatch that describe your Auto Scaling instances. These metrics
     * are available for any EC2 instance, not just those in an Auto Scaling group. For more
     * information, see Instance Metrics in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
     *
     * Auto Scaling groups can send metrics to CloudWatch that describe the group itself. You must
     * enable these metrics.
     *
     * To filter the metrics for your Auto Scaling group by group name, use the "AutoScalingGroupName"
     * dimension.
