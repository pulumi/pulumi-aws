/**
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### With Latest Version Of Launch Template
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const foobar = new aws.ec2.LaunchTemplate("foobar", {
 *     namePrefix: "foobar",
 *     imageId: "ami-1a2b3c",
 *     instanceType: "t2.micro",
 * });
 * const bar = new aws.autoscaling.Group("bar", {
 *     availabilityZones: ["us-east-1a"],
 *     desiredCapacity: 1,
 *     maxSize: 1,
 *     minSize: 1,
 *     launchTemplate: {
 *         id: foobar.id,
 *         version: `$Latest`,
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Mixed Instances Policy
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const exampleLaunchTemplate = new aws.ec2.LaunchTemplate("exampleLaunchTemplate", {
 *     namePrefix: "example",
 *     imageId: data.aws_ami.example.id,
 *     instanceType: "c5.large",
 * });
 * const exampleGroup = new aws.autoscaling.Group("exampleGroup", {
 *     availabilityZones: ["us-east-1a"],
 *     desiredCapacity: 1,
 *     maxSize: 1,
 *     minSize: 1,
 *     mixedInstancesPolicy: {
 *         launchTemplate: {
 *             launchTemplateSpecification: {
 *                 launchTemplateId: exampleLaunchTemplate.id,
 *             },
 *             overrides: [
 *                 {
 *                     instanceType: "c4.large",
 *                     weightedCapacity: "3",
 *                 },
 *                 {
 *                     instanceType: "c3.large",
 *                     weightedCapacity: "2",
 *                 },
 *             ],
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Mixed Instances Policy with Spot Instances and Capacity Rebalance
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const exampleLaunchTemplate = new aws.ec2.LaunchTemplate("exampleLaunchTemplate", {
 *     namePrefix: "example",
 *     imageId: data.aws_ami.example.id,
 *     instanceType: "c5.large",
 * });
 * const exampleGroup = new aws.autoscaling.Group("exampleGroup", {
 *     capacityRebalance: true,
 *     desiredCapacity: 12,
 *     maxSize: 15,
 *     minSize: 12,
 *     vpcZoneIdentifiers: [
 *         aws_subnet.example1.id,
 *         aws_subnet.example2.id,
 *     ],
 *     mixedInstancesPolicy: {
 *         instancesDistribution: {
 *             onDemandBaseCapacity: 0,
 *             onDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity: 25,
 *             spotAllocationStrategy: "capacity-optimized",
 *         },
 *         launchTemplate: {
 *             launchTemplateSpecification: {
 *                 launchTemplateId: exampleLaunchTemplate.id,
 *             },
 *             overrides: [
 *                 {
 *                     instanceType: "c4.large",
 *                     weightedCapacity: "3",
 *                 },
 *                 {
 *                     instanceType: "c3.large",
 *                     weightedCapacity: "2",
 *                 },
 *             ],
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Mixed Instances Policy with Instance level LaunchTemplateSpecification Overrides
 *
 * When using a diverse instance set, some instance types might require a launch template with configuration values unique to that instance type such as a different AMI (Graviton2), architecture specific user data script, different EBS configuration, or different networking configuration.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const exampleLaunchTemplate = new aws.ec2.LaunchTemplate("exampleLaunchTemplate", {
 *     namePrefix: "example",
 *     imageId: data.aws_ami.example.id,
 *     instanceType: "c5.large",
 * });
 * const example2 = new aws.ec2.LaunchTemplate("example2", {
 *     namePrefix: "example2",
 *     imageId: data.aws_ami.example2.id,
 * });
 * const exampleGroup = new aws.autoscaling.Group("exampleGroup", {
 *     availabilityZones: ["us-east-1a"],
 *     desiredCapacity: 1,
 *     maxSize: 1,
 *     minSize: 1,
 *     mixedInstancesPolicy: {
 *         launchTemplate: {
 *             launchTemplateSpecification: {
 *                 launchTemplateId: exampleLaunchTemplate.id,
 *             },
 *             overrides: [
 *                 {
 *                     instanceType: "c4.large",
 *                     weightedCapacity: "3",
 *                 },
 *                 {
 *                     instanceType: "c6g.large",
 *                     launchTemplateSpecification: {
 *                         launchTemplateId: example2.id,
 *                     },
 *                     weightedCapacity: "2",
 *                 },
 *             ],
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Automatically refresh all instances after the group is updated
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const exampleAmi = aws.ec2.getAmi({
 *     mostRecent: true,
 *     owners: ["amazon"],
 *     filters: [{
 *         name: "name",
 *         values: ["amzn-ami-hvm-*-x86_64-gp2"],
 *     }],
 * });
 * const exampleLaunchTemplate = new aws.ec2.LaunchTemplate("exampleLaunchTemplate", {
 *     imageId: exampleAmi.then(exampleAmi => exampleAmi.id),
 *     instanceType: "t3.nano",
 * });
 * const exampleGroup = new aws.autoscaling.Group("exampleGroup", {
 *     availabilityZones: ["us-east-1a"],
 *     desiredCapacity: 1,
 *     maxSize: 2,
 *     minSize: 1,
 *     launchTemplate: {
 *         id: exampleLaunchTemplate.id,
 *         version: exampleLaunchTemplate.latestVersion,
 *     },
 *     tags: [{
 *         key: "Key",
 *         value: "Value",
 *         propagateAtLaunch: true,
 *     }],
 *     instanceRefresh: {
 *         strategy: "Rolling",
 *         preferences: {
 *             minHealthyPercentage: 50,
 *         },
 *         triggers: ["tag"],
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Auto Scaling group with Warm Pool
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const exampleLaunchTemplate = new aws.ec2.LaunchTemplate("exampleLaunchTemplate", {
 *     namePrefix: "example",
 *     imageId: data.aws_ami.example.id,
 *     instanceType: "c5.large",
 * });
 * const exampleGroup = new aws.autoscaling.Group("exampleGroup", {
 *     availabilityZones: ["us-east-1a"],
 *     desiredCapacity: 1,
 *     maxSize: 5,
 *     minSize: 1,
 *     warmPool: {
 *         poolState: "Hibernated",
 *         minSize: 1,
 *         maxGroupPreparedCapacity: 10,
 *         instanceReusePolicy: {
 *             reuseOnScaleIn: true,
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ## Waiting for Capacity
 *
 * A newly-created ASG is initially empty and begins to scale to `minSize` (or
 * `desiredCapacity`, if specified) by launching instances using the provided
 * Launch Configuration. These instances take time to launch and boot.
 *
 * On ASG Update, changes to these values also take time to result in the target
 * number of instances providing service.
 *
 * This provider provides two mechanisms to help consistently manage ASG scale up
 * time across dependent resources.
 *
 * #### Waiting for ASG Capacity
 *
 * The first is default behavior. This provider waits after ASG creation for
 * `minSize` (or `desiredCapacity`, if specified) healthy instances to show up
 * in the ASG before continuing.
 *
 * If `minSize` or `desiredCapacity` are changed in a subsequent update,
 * this provider will also wait for the correct number of healthy instances before
 * continuing.
 *
 * This provider considers an instance "healthy" when the ASG reports `HealthStatus:
 * "Healthy"` and `LifecycleState: "InService"`. See the [AWS AutoScaling
 * Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/DeveloperGuide/AutoScalingGroupLifecycle.html)
 * for more information on an ASG's lifecycle.
 *
 * This provider will wait for healthy instances for up to
 * `waitForCapacityTimeout`. If ASG creation is taking more than a few minutes,
 * it's worth investigating for scaling activity errors, which can be caused by
 * problems with the selected Launch Configuration.
 *
 * Setting `waitForCapacityTimeout` to `"0"` disables ASG Capacity waiting.
 *
 * #### Waiting for ELB Capacity
 *
 * The second mechanism is optional, and affects ASGs with attached ELBs specified
 * via the `loadBalancers` attribute or with ALBs specified with `targetGroupArns`.
 *
 * The `minElbCapacity` parameter causes this provider to wait for at least the
 * requested number of instances to show up `"InService"` in all attached ELBs
 * during ASG creation.  It has no effect on ASG updates.
 *
 * If `waitForElbCapacity` is set, this provider will wait for exactly that number
 * of Instances to be `"InService"` in all attached ELBs on both creation and
 * updates.
 *
 * These parameters can be used to ensure that service is being provided before
 * the provider moves on. If new instances don't pass the ELB's health checks for any
 * reason, the apply will time out, and the ASG will be marked as
 * tainted (i.e., marked to be destroyed in a follow up run).
 *
 * As with ASG Capacity, this provider will wait for up to `waitForCapacityTimeout`
 * for the proper number of instances to be healthy.
 *
 * #### Troubleshooting Capacity Waiting Timeouts
 *
 * If ASG creation takes more than a few minutes, this could indicate one of a
 * number of configuration problems. See the [AWS Docs on Load Balancer
 * Troubleshooting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/elb-troubleshooting.html)
 * for more information.
