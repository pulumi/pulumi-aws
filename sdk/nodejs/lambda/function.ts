/**
 * Provides a Lambda Function resource. Lambda allows you to trigger execution of code in response to events in AWS, enabling serverless backend solutions. The Lambda Function itself includes source code and runtime configuration.
 *
 * For information about Lambda and how to use it, see [What is AWS Lambda?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html)
 *
 * > **NOTE:** Due to [AWS Lambda improved VPC networking changes that began deploying in September 2019](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/announcing-improved-vpc-networking-for-aws-lambda-functions/), EC2 subnets and security groups associated with Lambda Functions can take up to 45 minutes to successfully delete. To allow for successful deletion, the provider will wait for at least 45 minutes even if a shorter delete timeout is specified.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** If you get a `KMSAccessDeniedException: Lambda was unable to decrypt the environment variables because KMS access was denied` error when invoking an `aws.lambda.Function` with environment variables, the IAM role associated with the function may have been deleted and recreated _after_ the function was created. You can fix the problem two ways: 1) updating the function's role to another role and then updating it back again to the recreated role, or 2) by using Pulumi to `taint` the function and `apply` your configuration again to recreate the function. (When you create a function, Lambda grants permissions on the KMS key to the function's IAM role. If the IAM role is recreated, the grant is no longer valid. Changing the function's role or recreating the function causes Lambda to update the grant.)
 *
 * > To give an external source (like an EventBridge Rule, SNS, or S3) permission to access the Lambda function, use the `aws.lambda.Permission` resource. See [Lambda Permission Model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/intro-permission-model.html) for more details. On the other hand, the `role` argument of this resource is the function's execution role for identity and access to AWS services and resources.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Basic Example
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as archive from "@pulumi/archive";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const assumeRole = aws.iam.getPolicyDocument({
 *     statements: [{
 *         effect: "Allow",
 *         principals: [{
 *             type: "Service",
 *             identifiers: ["lambda.amazonaws.com"],
 *         }],
 *         actions: ["sts:AssumeRole"],
 *     }],
 * });
 * const iamForLambda = new aws.iam.Role("iam_for_lambda", {
 *     name: "iam_for_lambda",
 *     assumeRolePolicy: assumeRole.then(assumeRole => assumeRole.json),
 * });
 * const lambda = archive.getFile({
 *     type: "zip",
 *     sourceFile: "lambda.js",
 *     outputPath: "lambda_function_payload.zip",
 * });
 * const testLambda = new aws.lambda.Function("test_lambda", {
 *     code: new pulumi.asset.FileArchive("lambda_function_payload.zip"),
 *     name: "lambda_function_name",
 *     role: iamForLambda.arn,
 *     handler: "index.test",
 *     sourceCodeHash: lambda.then(lambda => lambda.outputBase64sha256),
 *     runtime: aws.lambda.Runtime.NodeJS18dX,
 *     environment: {
 *         variables: {
 *             foo: "bar",
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Lambda Layers
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.lambda.LayerVersion("example", {});
 * const exampleFunction = new aws.lambda.Function("example", {layers: [example.arn]});
 * ```
 *
 * ### Lambda Ephemeral Storage
 *
 * Lambda Function Ephemeral Storage(`/tmp`) allows you to configure the storage upto `10` GB. The default value set to `512` MB.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const assumeRole = aws.iam.getPolicyDocument({
 *     statements: [{
 *         effect: "Allow",
 *         principals: [{
 *             type: "Service",
 *             identifiers: ["lambda.amazonaws.com"],
 *         }],
 *         actions: ["sts:AssumeRole"],
 *     }],
 * });
 * const iamForLambda = new aws.iam.Role("iam_for_lambda", {
 *     name: "iam_for_lambda",
 *     assumeRolePolicy: assumeRole.then(assumeRole => assumeRole.json),
 * });
 * const testLambda = new aws.lambda.Function("test_lambda", {
 *     code: new pulumi.asset.FileArchive("lambda_function_payload.zip"),
 *     name: "lambda_function_name",
 *     role: iamForLambda.arn,
 *     handler: "index.test",
 *     runtime: aws.lambda.Runtime.NodeJS18dX,
 *     ephemeralStorage: {
 *         size: 10240,
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Lambda File Systems
 *
 * Lambda File Systems allow you to connect an Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) file system to a Lambda function to share data across function invocations, access existing data including large files, and save function state.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * // EFS file system
 * const efsForLambda = new aws.efs.FileSystem("efs_for_lambda", {tags: {
 *     Name: "efs_for_lambda",
 * }});
 * // Mount target connects the file system to the subnet
 * const alpha = new aws.efs.MountTarget("alpha", {
 *     fileSystemId: efsForLambda.id,
 *     subnetId: subnetForLambda.id,
 *     securityGroups: [sgForLambda.id],
 * });
 * // EFS access point used by lambda file system
 * const accessPointForLambda = new aws.efs.AccessPoint("access_point_for_lambda", {
 *     fileSystemId: efsForLambda.id,
 *     rootDirectory: {
 *         path: "/lambda",
 *         creationInfo: {
 *             ownerGid: 1000,
 *             ownerUid: 1000,
 *             permissions: "777",
 *         },
 *     },
 *     posixUser: {
 *         gid: 1000,
 *         uid: 1000,
 *     },
 * });
 * // A lambda function connected to an EFS file system
 * const example = new aws.lambda.Function("example", {
 *     fileSystemConfig: {
 *         arn: accessPointForLambda.arn,
 *         localMountPath: "/mnt/efs",
 *     },
 *     vpcConfig: {
 *         subnetIds: [subnetForLambda.id],
 *         securityGroupIds: [sgForLambda.id],
 *     },
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [alpha],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Lambda retries
 *
 * Lambda Functions allow you to configure error handling for asynchronous invocation. The settings that it supports are `Maximum age of event` and `Retry attempts` as stated in [Lambda documentation for Configuring error handling for asynchronous invocation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html#invocation-async-errors). To configure these settings, refer to the aws.lambda.FunctionEventInvokeConfig resource.
 *
 * ## CloudWatch Logging and Permissions
 *
 * For more information about CloudWatch Logs for Lambda, see the [Lambda User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-functions-logs.html).
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const config = new pulumi.Config();
 * const lambdaFunctionName = config.get("lambdaFunctionName") || "lambda_function_name";
 * // This is to optionally manage the CloudWatch Log Group for the Lambda Function.
 * // If skipping this resource configuration, also add "logs:CreateLogGroup" to the IAM policy below.
 * const example = new aws.cloudwatch.LogGroup("example", {
 *     name: `/aws/lambda/${lambdaFunctionName}`,
 *     retentionInDays: 14,
 * });
 * // See also the following AWS managed policy: AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole
 * const lambdaLogging = aws.iam.getPolicyDocument({
 *     statements: [{
 *         effect: "Allow",
 *         actions: [
 *             "logs:CreateLogGroup",
 *             "logs:CreateLogStream",
 *             "logs:PutLogEvents",
 *         ],
 *         resources: ["arn:aws:logs:*:*:*"],
 *     }],
 * });
 * const lambdaLoggingPolicy = new aws.iam.Policy("lambda_logging", {
 *     name: "lambda_logging",
 *     path: "/",
 *     description: "IAM policy for logging from a lambda",
 *     policy: lambdaLogging.then(lambdaLogging => lambdaLogging.json),
 * });
 * const lambdaLogs = new aws.iam.RolePolicyAttachment("lambda_logs", {
 *     role: iamForLambda.name,
 *     policyArn: lambdaLoggingPolicy.arn,
 * });
 * const testLambda = new aws.lambda.Function("test_lambda", {
 *     name: lambdaFunctionName,
 *     loggingConfig: {
 *         logFormat: "Text",
 *     },
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [
 *         lambdaLogs,
 *         example,
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Specifying the Deployment Package
 *
 * AWS Lambda expects source code to be provided as a deployment package whose structure varies depending on which `runtime` is in use. See [Runtimes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_CreateFunction.html#SSS-CreateFunction-request-Runtime) for the valid values of `runtime`. The expected structure of the deployment package can be found in [the AWS Lambda documentation for each runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/deployment-package-v2.html).
 *
 * Once you have created your deployment package you can specify it either directly as a local file (using the `filename` argument) or indirectly via Amazon S3 (using the `s3Bucket`, `s3Key` and `s3ObjectVersion` arguments). When providing the deployment package via S3 it may be useful to use the `aws.s3.BucketObjectv2` resource to upload it.
 *
 * For larger deployment packages it is recommended by Amazon to upload via S3, since the S3 API has better support for uploading large files efficiently.
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Using `pulumi import`, import Lambda Functions using the `function_name`. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import aws:lambda/function:Function test_lambda my_test_lambda_function
 * ```
 */
