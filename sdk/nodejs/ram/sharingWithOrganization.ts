/**
 * Manages Resource Access Manager (RAM) Resource Sharing with AWS Organizations. If you enable sharing with your organization, you can share resources without using invitations. Refer to the [AWS RAM user guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/getting-started-sharing.html#getting-started-sharing-orgs) for more details.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** Use this resource to manage resource sharing within your organization, **not** the `aws.organizations.Organization` resource with `ram.amazonaws.com` configured in `awsServiceAccessPrincipals`.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.ram/sharingWithOrganization.SharingWithOrganization("example", {});
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Using `pulumi import`, import the resource using the current AWS account ID. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:ram/sharingWithOrganization:SharingWithOrganization example 123456789012
 * ```
