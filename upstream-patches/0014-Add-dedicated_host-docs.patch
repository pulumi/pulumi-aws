+  Get information on a EC2 host.
+---
+
+# Data Source: aws_dedicated_host
+
+Use this data source to get information about the host when allocating an EC2 Dedicated Host.
+
+## Example Usage
+
+```hcl
+# Create a new host with instance type of c5.18xlarge with Auto Placement 
+# and Host Recovery enabled. 
+provider "aws" {
+  region = "us-west-2"
+}
+
+resource "aws_dedicated_host" "test" {
+  instance_type     = "c5.18xlarge"
+  availability_zone = "us-west-1a"
+  host_recovery     = "on"
+  auto_placement    = "on"
+}
+
+data "aws_dedicated_host" "test_data" {
+  host_id = "${aws_dedicated_host.test.id}"
+}
+```
+
+## Argument Reference
+
+The following arguments are supported:
+
+* `auto_placement` - (Optional) Indicates whether the host accepts any untargeted instance launches that match its instance type configuration, or if it only accepts Host tenancy instance launches that specify its unique host ID.
+* `availability_zone` - (Optional) The AZ to start the host in.
+* `host_recovery` - (Optional) Indicates whether to enable or disable host recovery for the Dedicated Host. Host recovery is disabled by default.
+* `instance_type` - (Optional) Specifies the instance type for which to configure your Dedicated Hosts. When you specify the instance type, that is the only instance type that you can launch onto that host. 
+
+
+
+
+
+### Timeouts
+
+The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) for certain actions:
+
+* `create` - (Defaults to 10 mins) Used when launching the host (until it reaches the initial `running` state)
+* `update` - (Defaults to 10 mins) Used when stopping and starting the host when necessary during update - e.g. when changing host type
+* `delete` - (Defaults to 20 mins) Used when terminating the host
+
+
+## Attributes Reference
+
+In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:
+
+* `host_id` - The host ID. 
+* `cores` - The number of cores on the Dedicated Host.
+* `instance_family` - The instance family supported by the Dedicated Host. For example, m5.
+* `instance_type` -The instance type supported by the Dedicated Host. For example, m5.large. If the host supports multiple instance types, no instanceType is returned.
+* `sockets` - The instance family supported by the Dedicated Host. For example, m5.
+* `total_vcpus` - The total number of vCPUs on the Dedicated Host.
+
+
+
+## Import
+
+hosts can be imported using the `host_id`, e.g.
+
+```
+$ terraform import aws_dedicated_host.host_id h-0385a99d0e4b20cbb
+```
