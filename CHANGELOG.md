* Several modules have been renamed to better align with their terraform equivalents.  The existing
  modules are still available, but will be deprecated and removed in the future. 'Aliases' have been
  used to ensure that moving to the new modules will not result in any changes to existing
  resources.  The renamed modules are:
  * `applicationloadbalancing -> alb`
  * `elasticloadbalancing     -> elb`
  * `elasticloadbalancingv2   -> lb`

## 0.18.23 (2019-07-19)

  We can now pass an `AssetArchive` to this parameter as follows:
  ```
  code: new asset.AssetArchive({
    "index.js": new asset.StringAsset(
        "exports.handler = (e, c, cb) => cb(null, {statusCode: 200, body: 'Hello, world!'});",
    ),
  })
  ```
* Add the ability to specify `elastic_search_*` `access_policies` as iam.PolicyDocument
* Add the ability to pass a `RoutingRule` array to the `routingRules` field in `aws.s3.Bucket`'s `website` field
* Add the ability to specify ecr_repository `policy` as iam.PolicyDocument

## 0.18.14 (2019-06-24)
* Update to v0.17.20 of @pulumi/pulumi.  This pulls in a fix related to crashing with aliases.

* Fix an issue where the pulumi_aws Python package would fail to install in some cases

## 0.18.10 (2019-06-13)

Note: new constants may cause existing code to break due to the types being narrower in TypeScript.
If you run into issues, you can cast to the specific type (i.e. `<EngineType>someStr`) if the TypeScript
compiler complains.

* Upgrade to v2.15.0 of the AWS Terraform Provider
* Add module containing constants for ALB IpAddressType and LoadBalancer type
* Add module containing constants for Aurora-based RDS Cluster `EngineType` and `EngineMode`

* Add the ability to pass a `PolicyDocument` to the `policy` field in `aws.s3.Bucket`
* Subscription resources will now be parented by default by the resource they were created off of.
  This has been implemented using 'aliases' so this will not have any effect on existing stacks.

## 0.18.8 (2019-06-06)

* Update to v1.54.0 of the AWS Terraform provider
* Change the type of properties previously typed as `aws.Tag` to allow `Output<string>` to be used as Tag values

## 0.16.4 (2019-12-17)
* Update to v1.52.0 of the AWS Terraform provider

## 0.16.3 (2019-12-05)
* Update to v1.50.0 of the AWS Terraform provider

* Support Python 3.6 and higher, instead of only Python 3.7

## 0.16.1 (2018-10-23)
* Update to the v1.14.0 version of the AWS Provider [pulumi/pulumi-aws#355](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws/pull/355)
* Add definitions for S3 Canned ACLs [pulumi/pulumi-aws#351](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws/pull/355)
* Add serverless methods to Kinesis streams [pulumi/pulumi-aws#345](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws/pull/345)

## 0.16.0 (2018-10-15)
* Moved all `@pulumi/aws-serverless` features down into `@pulumi/aws`.  Event handlers are now available as methods like `bucket.onObjectCreated` from instances of `aws.s3.Bucket` and all other Lambda event sources.  In addition, the `aws.apigateway.x.API` type is available for simple construction of API Gateways directly in the `@pulumi/aws` package.
* Added richer typing for many EC2 and Autoscaling resources.  Thanks to [@jen20](https://github.com/jen20)! [pulumi/pulumi-aws#323](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws/pull/323) [pulumi/pulumi-aws#324](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws/pull/324)
* Adopted `v1.38.0` of the AWS Terraform Provider. [pulumi/pulumi-aws#341](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws/pull/341)

## 0.15.1 (2018-09-11)
* Add dotnetcore2.1 as a runtime for AWS lambdas (thanks to **[@Jtango18](https://github.com/Jtango18)**!). [pulumi/pulumi-aws#302](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws/pull/302)
* Expose 'factory functions' from pulumi-aws. [pulumi/pulumi-aws#304](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws/pull/304)
* Use stronger IAM doc types. [pulumi/pulumi-aws#311](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws/pull/311)
* Auto-name aws.elasticache.Cluster#clusterId, [pulumi/pulumi-aws#313](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws/pull/313)

## 0.15.0 (2018-08-13)
* Adopted `terraform-provider-aws` version 1.30.0, with new support for Amazon Neptune, AWS Storage Gateway, Amazon Macie, and much more.

## 0.14.5 (2018-07-20)
* Only apply AutoName to inputs ([pulumi/pulumi-aws#265](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws/pull/265)). Terraform properties named `name` but are not inputs do not have auto naming applied to them.
* Switch package inclusion from whitelist to blacklist ([pulumi/pulumi-aws#268](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws/pull/265)). When serializing a lambda, default to including all dependencies listed in the dependencies section of package.json (and their transitive dependencies) except for all `@pulumi/*` packages. Previously we tried to infer the set of packages by doing a more detailed analysis of the lambda implementation, but this failed in somewhat common cases.
* Fix null ref when walking packages ([pulumi/pulumi-aws#280](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws/pull/280)). Fix some issues that could arise when serializing lambdas when a dependent package had no dependencies itself.
* Add autoscaling NotificationType union and overlay ([pulumi/pulumi-aws#251](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/pull/251)). Provide a more strongly typed experience for setting autoscaling notification types. Special thanks to [@jen20](https://github.com/jen20) for this improvement.
* Add iam.assumeRolePolicyForPrincipal function ([pulumi/pulumi-aws#273](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws/pull/273)). Add some helpers for authoring policy documents to assume a role. Special thanks to [@jen20](https://github.com/jen20) for this improvement.
* Add `environment` to `aws.serverless.Function` ([pulumi/pulumi-aws#254](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws/pull/254). Expose the underlying `Environment` property to allow setting environment variables visible at runtime of a function when using `aws.serverless.Function`. Special thanks to [@jen20](https://github.com/jen20) for this improvement.
* Override role on RolePolicy to accept a Role ([pulumi/pulumi-aws#278](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws/pull/278)). When constructing a `RolePolicy` object, allow the `Role` object to set as an argument instead of just a string which is the ARN of the role to use. Special thanks to [@jen20](https://github.com/jen20) for this improvement.
* Add the .js extension to our generate closure code file. ([pulumi/pulumi-aws#279](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws/pull/279)). Ensure the generated code uploaded to AWS has a `.js` extension when building a lambda function. This allows the code for the lambda to be viewed in the AWS console.

## 0.14.2 (2018-07-03)
* The result of calls to data sources now include an `id` property. Special thanks to [@Frassle](https://github.com/Frassle) for adding this support in [pulumi/pulumi-terraform#189](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-terraform/pull/189).
* Adopt [v1.26.0](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1260-july-04-2018) of the AWS Terraform Provider.

## 0.13.0 (2018-05-19)
* Allow passing an existing `Role` to `serverless.Function` ([pulumi/pulumi-aws#210](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws/pull/210)). FunctionOptions now includes a `Role` property, for scenarios where you wish to use an existing `Role` or share one across multiple Lambda functions.
* (**Breaking**) Support configuring the paths to include in `serverless.Function` ([pulumi/pulumi-aws#210](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws/pull/210)). Previously, all files in the directory would be included in the Lambda deployment package. With this change, only the generated `__index.js` and `./node_modules` are included by default. To add other files, use the new `includePaths` property in FunctionOptions.
* (**Breaking**) Rename `aws.s3.Bucket#websites` to the singular `aws.s3.Bucket#website`. ([pulumi/pulumi-aws#207](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws/pull/207)). Since this property contains only one element, it has been renamed to `website` (singular) and is no longer an array property.
