/**
 * Provides an Elastic Beanstalk Application Version Resource. Elastic Beanstalk allows
 * you to deploy and manage applications in the AWS cloud without worrying about
 * the infrastructure that runs those applications.
 * 
 * This resource creates a Beanstalk Application Version that can be deployed to a Beanstalk
 * Environment.
 * 
 * ~> **NOTE on Application Version Resource:**  When using the Application Version resource with multiple 
 * [Elastic Beanstalk Environments](elastic_beanstalk_environment.html) it is possible that an error may be returned
 * when attempting to delete an Application Version while it is still in use by a different environment.
 * To work around this you can:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Create each environment in a separate AWS account</li>
 * <li>Create your `aws_elastic_beanstalk_application_version` resources with a unique names in your 
 * Elastic Beanstalk Application. For example &lt;revision&gt;-&lt;environment&gt;.</li>
 * </ol>
