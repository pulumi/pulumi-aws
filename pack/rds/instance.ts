/**
 * Provides an RDS instance resource.  A DB instance is an isolated database
 * environment in the cloud.  A DB instance can contain multiple user-created
 * databases.
 * 
 * Changes to a DB instance can occur when you manually change a parameter, such as
 * `allocated_storage`, and are reflected in the next maintenance window. Because
 * of this, Terraform may report a difference in its planning phase because a
 * modification has not yet taken place. You can use the `apply_immediately` flag
 * to instruct the service to apply the change immediately (see documentation
 * below).
 * 
 * When upgrading the major version of an engine, `allow_major_version_upgrade`
 * must be set to `true`.
 * 
 * ~> **Note:** using `apply_immediately` can result in a brief downtime as the
 * server reboots. See the AWS Docs on [RDS Maintenance][2] for more information.
 * 
 * ~> **Note:** All arguments including the username and password will be stored in
 * the raw state as plain-text. [Read more about sensitive data in
 * state](/docs/state/sensitive-data.html).
