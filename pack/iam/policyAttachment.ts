/**
 * Attaches a Managed IAM Policy to user(s), role(s), and/or group(s)
 * 
 * !> **WARNING:** The aws_iam_policy_attachment resource creates **exclusive** attachments of IAM policies. Across the entire AWS account, all of the users/roles/groups to which a single policy is attached must be declared by a single aws_iam_policy_attachment resource. This means that even any users/roles/groups that have the attached policy via some mechanism other than Terraform will have that attached policy revoked by Terraform. Consider `aws_iam_role_policy_attachment`, `iam_user_policy_attachment`, or `iam_group_policy_attachment` instead. These resources do not enforce exclusive attachment of an IAM policy. 
 * 
 * ```hcl
 * resource "aws_iam_user" "user" {
 *   name = "test-user"
 * }
 * 
 * resource "aws_iam_role" "role" {
 *   name = "test-role"
 * }
 * 
 * resource "aws_iam_group" "group" {
 *   name = "test-group"
 * }
 * 
 * resource "aws_iam_policy" "policy" {
 *   name        = "test-policy"
 *   description = "A test policy"
 *   policy      =  # omitted
 * }
 * 
 * resource "aws_iam_policy_attachment" "test-attach" {
 *   name       = "test-attachment"
 *   users      = ["${aws_iam_user.user.name}"]
 *   roles      = ["${aws_iam_role.role.name}"]
 *   groups     = ["${aws_iam_group.group.name}"]
 *   policy_arn = "${aws_iam_policy.policy.arn}"
