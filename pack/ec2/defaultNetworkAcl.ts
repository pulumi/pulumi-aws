/**
 * Provides a resource to manage the default AWS Network ACL. VPC Only.
 * 
 * Each VPC created in AWS comes with a Default Network ACL that can be managed, but not
 * destroyed. **This is an advanced resource**, and has special caveats to be aware
 * of when using it. Please read this document in its entirety before using this
 * resource.
 * 
 * The `aws_default_network_acl` behaves differently from normal resources, in that
 * Terraform does not _create_ this resource, but instead attempts to "adopt" it
 * into management. We can do this because each VPC created has a Default Network
 * ACL that cannot be destroyed, and is created with a known set of default rules.
 * 
 * When Terraform first adopts the Default Network ACL, it **immediately removes all
 * rules in the ACL**. It then proceeds to create any rules specified in the
 * configuration. This step is required so that only the rules specified in the
 * configuration are created.
 * 
 * This resource treats its inline rules as absolute; only the rules defined
 * inline are created, and any additions/removals external to this resource will
 * result in diffs being shown. For these reasons, this resource is incompatible with the
 * `aws_network_acl_rule` resource.
 * 
 * For more information about Network ACLs, see the AWS Documentation on
 * [Network ACLs][aws-network-acls].
