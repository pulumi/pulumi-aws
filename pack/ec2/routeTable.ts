/**
 * Provides a resource to create a VPC routing table.
 * 
 * ~> **NOTE on Route Tables and Routes:** Terraform currently
 * provides both a standalone [Route resource](route.html) and a Route Table resource with routes
 * defined in-line. At this time you cannot use a Route Table with in-line routes
 * in conjunction with any Route resources. Doing so will cause
 * a conflict of rule settings and will overwrite rules.
 * 
 * ~> **NOTE on `gateway_id` and `nat_gateway_id`:** The AWS API is very forgiving with these two
 * attributes and the `aws_route_table` resource can be created with a NAT ID specified as a Gateway ID attribute.
 * This _will_ lead to a permanent diff between your configuration and statefile, as the API returns the correct
 * parameters in the returned route table. If you're experiencing constant diffs in your `aws_route_table` resources,
 * the first thing to check is whether or not you're specifying a NAT ID instead of a Gateway ID, or vice-versa.
 * 
 * ~> **NOTE on `propagating_vgws` and the `aws_vpn_gateway_route_propagation` resource:**
 * If the `propagating_vgws` argument is present, it's not supported to _also_
 * define route propagations using `aws_vpn_gateway_route_propagation`, since
 * this resource will delete any propagating gateways not explicitly listed in
 * `propagating_vgws`. Omit this argument when defining route propagation using
 * the separate resource.
