/**
 * The "AMI copy" resource allows duplication of an Amazon Machine Image (AMI),
 * including cross-region copies.
 * 
 * If the source AMI has associated EBS snapshots, those will also be duplicated
 * along with the AMI.
 * 
 * This is useful for taking a single AMI provisioned in one region and making
 * it available in another for a multi-region deployment.
 * 
 * Copying an AMI can take several minutes. The creation of this resource will
 * block until the new AMI is available for use on new instances.
