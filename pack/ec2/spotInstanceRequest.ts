/**
 * Provides an EC2 Spot Instance Request resource. This allows instances to be
 * requested on the spot market.
 * 
 * Terraform always creates Spot Instance Requests with a `persistent` type, which
 * means that for the duration of their lifetime, AWS will launch an instance
 * with the configured details if and when the spot market will accept the
 * requested price.
 * 
 * On destruction, Terraform will make an attempt to terminate the associated Spot
 * Instance if there is one present.
 * 
 * ~> **NOTE:** Because their behavior depends on the live status of the spot
 * market, Spot Instance Requests have a unique lifecycle that makes them behave
 * differently than other Terraform resources. Most importantly: there is __no
 * guarantee__ that a Spot Instance exists to fulfill the request at any given
 * point in time. See the [AWS Spot Instance
 * documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-spot-instances.html)
 * for more information.
