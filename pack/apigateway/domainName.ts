/**
 * Registers a custom domain name for use with AWS API Gateway.
 * 
 * This resource just establishes ownership of and the TLS settings for
 * a particular domain name. An API can be attached to a particular path
 * under the registered domain name using
 * [the `aws_api_gateway_base_path_mapping` resource](api_gateway_base_path_mapping.html).
 * 
 * Internally API Gateway creates a CloudFront distribution to
 * route requests on the given hostname. In addition to this resource
 * it's necessary to create a DNS record corresponding to the
 * given domain name which is an alias (either Route53 alias or
 * traditional CNAME) to the Cloudfront domain name exported in the
 * `cloudfront_domain_name` attribute.
 * 
 * ~> **Note:** All arguments including the private key will be stored in the raw state as plain-text.
 * [Read more about sensitive data in state](/docs/state/sensitive-data.html).
